 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

An average person handles a lot of stress on a daily basis, whether at work, in traffic, or at home. We are all looking for ways to relax and to get our minds off the things that are stressing us out. ASMR videos have become a global trend that tends to do just that, provide relaxation, and help people deal with anxiety and depression.

Unaspiringly, there are hundreds of ASMR app that are compatible with iOS and Android devices you can use to relieve stress whenever you get a chance. We’ve selected some of the best ASMR apps for Android and iOS in order to help you find the one that best fits your needs.

## The Best Relaxation ASMR Apps for Android and iOS

The types of ASMR triggers the app offers, the diversity of its video selection or the quality of the audio are all important factors you will have to consider while choosing the ASMR app. Moreover, some apps enable you to customize the relaxing sounds that help you fall asleep. So, let's take a look at what the best relaxation ASMR apps for Android and iOS have to offer.

### 1\. [TeasEar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/teasear-asmr-slime-simulator/id1439312630)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facemetrics.asmr&hl=en)

Textures can suite your nerves even if they are virtual. TeasEar enables you to simulate a more than a hundred slimy textures. Yogurt, Honey, or Confetti are just a few of the most popular textures you can experiment with, but there are many more available.

The app also lets you interact with each texture you generate, as you just have to place your fingers onto the surface of your Smartphone in order to produce the sound that can potentially trigger the ASMR.

However, the free version of the app grants you access to only a limited amount of triggers and you must purchase a weekly or monthly subscription in order to unlock all the triggers this app has to offer.

### 2\. [Tingles](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tingles-asmr-white-noise/id1181126709)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.designs1290.tingles&hl=en)

If you are looking for an app that can help you overcome insomnia, improve the quality of your sleep, or cope with anxiety then you should try installing Tingles. By doing so you will be able to watch videos from more than 1500 content creators.

The app allows you to listen to the video even when your screen is off, and you can also download content from Tingles and watch it while you are offline. You can browse through thousands of hours of content and choose to watch or listen to the videos that relax you the most. The app also has a sleep timer that ensures you’ll wake up when you want to. It also offers the option to extend the timer for up to 30 minutes if you don’t feel like getting out of bed just yet.

### 3\. [Somnia](https://somnia.app/)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

As its name suggests this app was designed with the aim to improve the quality of sleep of its users. It is predominantly focused on audio triggers as it offers an impressive collection of fully customizable sounds. Furthermore, Somnia features spatialized True 3D soundscapes that develop as they progress which ultimately helps you fall asleep.

The soundscapes rely on the binaural audio to provide an immersive experience and you can use the Wind Down Timer to set how long the soundscape is going to be playing before stopping. The app also lets you choose your favorite themes of sounds and it adjusts to your preferences over time. Somnia offers Aubits, continuously blended, and mixed sound bits that can be used to create your own soundscapes. Keep in mind that you must purchase one of the available subscription packages if you want to use this app on an ongoing basis.

### 4\. [Mindwell](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.monclarity.mindwell&hl=en)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindwell-mood-sleep-lab/id1242454382), Android

Mindwell isn’t necessarily an ASMR app, as it doesn’t really offer any of the known visual, tactile, or audio ASMR triggers. Nonetheless, the app helps its users improve the quality of their sleep by offering more than 350 daily mediations that last between one and thirty minutes. In addition, Mindwell also combines custom Solfeggio frequencies with custom isochronic tones in order to synchronize with your brainwaves and help you achieve the state of calmness.

Mindwell can help you be more alert while performing daily tasks, establish the emotional balance by offering different types of sound waves that assist you in achieving a particular goal, or get into a specific mood. This app provides a perfect way to end the day as it enables you to create a playlist of specialized mediation programs.

The app lets you discover new videos daily, follow your favorite ASMR channels or share the ASMR videos you like on social media.

Finding ASMR content through the YouTube app is easy as there are so many different channels that produce videos that contain different types of ASMR triggers. On YouTube, you can find videos in which hosts are whispering into the microphone or tapping gently on it, as well as a broad range of videos that contain visual ASMR triggers. Although you can use the app for free, purchasing the YouTube Red or YouTube Premium will grant you access to a broader selection of ASMR videos.

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

Besides listening to music and podcasts, you can also use Spotify to discover ASMR content. You can find entire playlists that are dedicated to ASMR, so it is highly unlikely that you are going to have much trouble finding content that will help you relax or fall asleep.

The app’s modernly designed player makes it easy to save your favorite ASMR tracks to a playlist you can access in just a few taps. Moreover, Spotify’s algorithm recommends tracks based on the type of content you’re already listened to, which enables you to discover new ASMR recordings every day. The app is also equipped with a sleep timer so that you can doze off without having to worry if you are going to wake up on time. You’ll have to make an in-app purchase if you want to use Spotify’s premium features.

Optionally, you can switch on the shuffle mode and let the app select the ASMR sounds for you automatically.

You can listen to the sounds from the ASMRtist even while your device is in the lock screen mode, which enables you to continue with your daily activities or fall asleep and continue listening to ASMR sounds. The app has a Countdown Timer so that you can choose how long you want to sleep. The app’s dark background contributes to its relaxing and calming capabilities.

### 8\. [Super Slime Simulator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-slime-simulator/id1375330146)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dramaton.slime&hl=en)

If you like playing with slime and hearing the sounds it produces, then you shouldn’t miss out on Super Slime Simulator.

Once you’ve selected the type of slime you want to play with you can start squishing, stretching, or popping it.

All slimes have a different texture and create different 3D sounds when you interact with them. The app also has the Fun Area where you can complete Lu Lu’s Slime quests, turn photos into slime, or even try slime painting. All you need to do in order to undo a stretch is shake your phone and you can continue playing with the slime you selected. Super Slime Simulator offers a unique ASMR experience although you must make in-app purchases in order to enjoy it fully.

### 9\. [ASMR Slicing](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/asmr-slicing/id1494458254)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crazylabs.asmr.cut&hl=en)

The sound of cutting through sand may be satisfying and trigger the AMSR. This app enables you to cut through different types of objects made from sand. The realistic simulation of the cutting process, the sounds created while cutting through objects make playing this video game incredibly fun.

As you are leveling up, you’re gathering gold and unlocking new objects you can cut which makes the game more fun to play as you progress through it. Playing the ASMR Slicing game is certainly entertaining, as the relaxing sounds you’re making while cutting objects help you get rid of the stress. Even so, the app doesn’t really improve the quality of your sleep or assist you in overcoming anxiety or depression.

### 10\. [ASMR Breakfast](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.JaddZayed.Breakfast&hl=en)

**Compatibility:** Android

Preparing food is in itself a satisfying process that often enables us to forget about the daily troubles. ASMR Breakfast is a video game that simulates the process of preparing breakfast and challenges you to prepare a perfect meal.

Moreover, the app displays ads which can spoil the fun and make playing the game less entertaining.

### 11\. Silk ASMR
