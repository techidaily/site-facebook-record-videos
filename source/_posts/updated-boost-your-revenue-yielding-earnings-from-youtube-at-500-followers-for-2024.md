## Boost Your Revenue: Yielding Earnings From YouTube at 500 Followers

For small creators on YouTube, getting monetized seemed like an uphill task. You had to accumulate over 1,000 subscribers and over 4,000 public watch hours. This can be difficult to attain, especially on a platform where creators are publishing new content every day. However, the 2023 update on the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) provided an easier way to start making money on YouTube. In this article, we look at how the YPP is changing and the beauty of the YouTube monetization 500 subscribers’ policy update.

## **Part 1.** **YouTube Monetization Revamp: 500 Subscribers Minimum Threshold Unveiled**

The recent update in YouTube monetization requirements has made it easier than ever for small creators to make money on the platform. The YPP program changed and reduced the number of subscribers needed to be eligible. It has also reduced the amount of watch time needed. Let’s have a look at what the new eligibility criteria look like:

![new eligibility criteria](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/unlock-youtube-monetization-with-500-subscribers-1.JPG)

The eligibility criteria for the YPP program are now easier and more achievable than before. To apply, you now need:

* At least 500 subscribers
* Three Shorts or Video uploads in the last 90 days
* At least 3,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or
* At least 3 million public Short videos in the last 90 days

The new requirements are lower than the old ones. Previously, you were required to have at least 1,000 subscribers with over 4,000 public watch hours. By lowering the threshold, YouTube makes it easier for all creators to monetize their content.

## **Part 2\. YouTube Monetization with 500 Subscribers: A Brief Guide**

YouTube announced in 2022 that they were evolving the YPP to continue rewarding more creators. Starting mid-June 2023, the program was expanded to allow more creators to access monetization benefits.

### **Know If You are Eligible**

As a creator, you will want to know if you are eligible for the YouTube monetization 500 subscribers’ plan. Make sure that the notify feature on your channel is active to receive a notification. Go to the Earn area of the YouTube channel, and select Get Notified. Once selected, YouTube will send you an email when reach above the eligibility threshold.

### **Where to Apply for Monetization**

After meeting the eligibility criteria, you will need to apply to be enrolled in the YPP. Remember that being eligible does not automatically translate to instant income. You need to apply for the program and wait for the approval. Here are the steps to follow:

#### **On Computer/Desktop**

![Image alt: youtube adsense](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/unlock-youtube-monetization-with-500-subscribers-6.JPG)

#### **On Android, iPhone and iPad**

Applying for YouTube monetization on your mobile devices follows the same process as the computer. Only in this case you will using the YouTube Studio app instead of the website. Follow these steps as outlined.

* Open the YouTube Studio mobile app on your Android device.
* Tap Earn from the bottom men
* Tap Apply now to review and accept the base terms.
* Set up an AdSense account as requested, or link an existing active one.

Once you complete these steps on your computer or mobile, In Progress status will surface in the Get Reviewed step. This means that YouTube will review your channel and provide feedback within a month.

### **What Monetization Review Entails**

Once you submit your application, YouTube’s automated systems and human reviewers will look at your channel for a while. They will review it to make sure it follows all the platform’s policies and guidelines. As the reviews are in progress, creators are encouraged to back to the Earn section of YouTube Studio regularly. Typically, you will get the results within a month, but this may be affected by several factors:

* Application Volumes
* Resource Limitations
* System Issues
* Channel requiring several reviewers to determine suitability for YPP

Sometimes the first application may not be successful for some reason. In this case, creators are encouraged to continue uploading original content and try again after 30 days. For second or other rejections, you are allowed to try again after 90 days. During this period, make sure that your channel follows YouTube policies and guidelines to increase your chances of being accepted.

### **Choose How to Earn**

The major way of earning money on YouTube is through ads that show in your videos. In the case of Shorts, the ad-sharing revenue involves YouTube sharing the revenue generated from the ads with creators. However, getting accepted to YPP also allows you to start earning with fan funding and Shopping features. This means that creators can earn money directly from their views using these unique features
