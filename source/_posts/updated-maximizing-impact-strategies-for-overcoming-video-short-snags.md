## Importance of a Banner for Your YouTube Gaming Channel

Imagine a scenario where you want to open a brick-and-mortar store. One of the most important things you need to get out of the way is the business name. Once you have settled on a fitting name, you will then move on to create a sign to place outside your shop.

For example, a banner for your YouTube gaming channel plays a similar role to signage for a brick-and-mortar shop.

* An excellent banner helps you make a solid first impression on your viewers, some of who is viewing your content for the first time.
* Secondly, a well-designed banner reflects positively on your brand and helps you grow your audience at a steady rate.
* Thirdly, you can use your banner to give your viewers a rough idea of what your video is about without them clicking to watch. A suitable banner can cause anticipation to build within your viewers. Once the video is over, they won’t resist visiting your channel to see what else you offer.

## Guide to YouTube Gaming Banner Size

We can liken a banner for your YouTube video to a book cover to a novel you have been dying to read. Therefore, it would be wise to get the size right if you want to create an excellent first impression for yourself. Ideally, the best size for a YouTube banner is 2560\*1440 pixels or an aspect ratio of 16:9.

We urge you not to upload a banner smaller than 2048\*1152 pixels, or else the image will appear cropped. Keep your banner within 1235\*338 pixels and centered on the screen to be on the safe side.

This YouTube banner dimension is ideal for viewing on any device since your audience might use their smartphones or laptop to watch your videos on YouTube. Lastly, ensure you keep the file to a maximum of 6MB. We believe this file size is pretty generous.

## Tips for Designing an Attractive Gaming YouTube Banner

Below are some tips that will help you create beautiful YouTube banners.

Simplicity is key: Contrary to popular belief, a simple banner looks more polished than a complex one. If your YouTube banner has too many elements, your viewers using their mobile phones might have a challenge viewing the image.

Ensure the graphics are high-quality : Nothing is as frustrating to your viewers as seeing a blurry or pixelated YouTube banner. However, high-quality graphics with a resolution of at least 1920\*1080 pixels make your work look polished and attract more viewers to your channel.

Leverage the grid system: Some of your viewers might watch your videos from their smartphones, and others on their laptops or tablets. The grid system allows you to ensure the full banner will be visible no matter what device your audience will use to watch your gaming videos.

Add a CTA: At the end of the day, you are trying to grow your audience on your YouTube channel. You might also have other social media platforms where you post content. Since your banner is one of the first things your audience will see, you could include a short, easy-to-read, and understandable call to action. For instance, you could encourage them to “Subscribe Now!”

Incorporate your unique color scheme: By now, you already have a theme for your YouTube channel that your existing subscribers associate with you. As you design your YouTube banner, ensure you incorporate your theme colors, so new visitors know what colors to look out for as they scroll on the platform.
