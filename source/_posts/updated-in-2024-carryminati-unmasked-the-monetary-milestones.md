You don’t need a desktop-based software to extract tags from a YouTube video, because online tag extractors can generate a list of video’s tags within seconds.

#### #2\. How to Change YouTube Video Tags?

Make sure that you are logged in to YouTube Studio, and click on the **Video Manager** option that is located in the menu on the left side of the screen. The Info and Settings page contains the Basic Info section where you can remove existing tags and replace them with new ones.

**Conclusion**

It is almost impossible to overestimate the importance of tags for the number of views and likes your YouTube videos are getting. Luckily, online YouTube tag extractors grant you the insight into the tags other video content producers on the platform are using.

If you are a YouTuber who want to create videos with templates and effects without much efforts, you should try an [effective video editing software for YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
