Here are the steps to add the best hashtags for YouTube shorts:

**Step 1**: At first when you begin you need to do some research to find out which hashtags have quality videos based on the content type.

**Step 2**: Then choose a minimum of 3 hashtags to the end of your description in your video and add them.

**Step 3**: Once you are done with adding save your description. Here the added hashtags would appear as a blue link.

**Step 4**: Lastly, you need to click on save and check your title to see if they show up above it.

That's it! It's done!

### 3.YouTube Suggests

One of the most popular ways to find the best hashtags for YouTuber shorts is to write "#" into a YouTube search and once done it would show you hashtags that are the most used and trending ones. You can also type in "#a", "#b" etc. to find unique hashtag ideas.

### 4\. Create A Branded Hashtag

If you create branded hashtags and any users click on any of the hashtags, then the search results are dominated by your videos… not videos from other channels. So once you click on those hashtags you get a list of more videos from their channel.
