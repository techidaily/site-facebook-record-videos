But with so much music content on YouTube Music, finding the right mix for you can take time and effort. That's why we've put together this guide on **how to find my playlists on YouTube.**

We'll also answer some frequently asked questions to help you find solutions regarding the YouTube Mix queries. So, without wasting time, let's get on with the guide!

## Basic Information of YouTube Mix

Before starting, let's learn some basic information about the YouTube Music Mix playlists:

### Three Ways Of YouTube Music Mix

YouTube has popularized three personalized mixes to keep you up-to-date on newly released music and introduce more artists to you:

**Discover Mix:** Discover Mix introduces you to 50 new tracks every week, expanding your musical horizons and introducing you to contemporary artists. This playlist mix provides new updates every Wednesday, making it a go-to playlist for discovering new music to your taste.

**New Release Mix:** In the New Release Mix playlist, you can find all the newest tracks from your favorite artists, and some music is recommended. New updates are provided every Friday (when most new releases come out), and mid-week releases the entire week to ensure you're always up-to-date on the latest music.

**Your Mix:** Your Mix is a playlist full of songs by popular and well-known artists, as well as some new tunes and performers you've never discovered before, which are recommended based on your preferences, making it ideal for unwinding and listening to something you're guaranteed to love. The playlist is updated regularly, so the music never gets dull, and there's always something new to listen to.

### What Is YouTube Music Replay Mix?

YouTube Music Replay Mix is a feature of YouTube Music that is automatically generated via the YouTube algorithm and contains a personalized mix of tracks based on your listening history. The mix is updated daily and includes up to 100 songs.

You can access it by tapping the **"Replay Mix"** option on the YouTube app's main screen or the [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/) website. This feature is perfect for those who want a continuously updated mix of their favorite songs.

It is significant for a business to stay connected to its customers and videos are a wonderful medium to build that connect! Dailymotion gives you a golden opportunity and platform to share your videos on websites other than YouTube. This means that you can transfer your videos from YouTube to dailymotion in few minutes and increase the audience. There is no direct transfer feature in YouTube and hence this post will help in guiding how can you transfer the video content from YouTube to Dailymotion!

* [Method 1: Download YouTube video and upload to Dailymotion](#part1)
* [Method 2: Sync YouTube videos to Dailymotion](#part2)

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.

## Method 1: Download YouTube video and upload to Dailymotion

This one is little longer but many people vote for it as a safer one! All you have to do is to login to your YouTube official account and download all the videos that you have uploaded in MP4 format by clicking on Edit option appearing at right of the video.

Ready to learn [How to Download YouTube Videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) . It's easy, fun and a great way to share your movies with the world.

Save it to the desired folder on your PC and navigate to the Dailymotion account page. Sign in with your credentials and click on upload video. Browse the video from the location where you saved, give it a title and description.

![dailymotion-uploading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dailymotion-uploading.jpg)

Next, click on channel drop-down menu and choose a category which best describes your video. Besides this, you would see a ‘Tags’ text box. You can add one or more tags (maximum 10) and select the privacy options as per your requirement. Tags act as a criterion for SEO optimization and help people in finding your video. Finally, just click on save to upload the video on dailymotion.

## Method 2: Sync YouTube videos to Dailymotion

You can do this by liaising with Freedom MCN Network as it allows you to grow faster on Dailymotion. All you have to do is to search for ‘dashboard.tm’ on Google and sign in using you email and password. It will direct you to Dailymotion page; you can also opt to sign in with your Facebook credentials. When you will press enter and login, the first screen only will show the prompt if you want to synch YouTube and Dailymotion channels? Since, our answer is yes, the screen will ask you to login into your YouTube account and the screen will navigate you to the login into Google account linked to your YouTube account. Just like in all apps, you have to allow Freedom to access the data from your YouTube account. The next screen will list down number of videos that have been uploaded to your YouTube Account and the ones which are already synched with Dailymotion will have a check against their name. The ones which are not synched will have a box; you can simply check it and click on ‘Synch videos’ at the top right corner.

![ Sync Dailymotion video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sync-dailymotion-video.jpg)

It will ask for your email address to get notifications, put in your email ID and click on Sync. Once they are active and synched you will receive a notification on your email with a subject ‘Done reuploading’ followed by the tile of the video. This simply means that you need not upload any video separately on dailymotion, you can simply synch it with YouTube and put in your efforts of uploading only once!
