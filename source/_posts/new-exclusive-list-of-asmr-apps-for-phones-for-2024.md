An average person handles a lot of stress on a daily basis, whether at work, in traffic, or at home. We are all looking for ways to relax and to get our minds off the things that are stressing us out. ASMR videos have become a global trend that tends to do just that, provide relaxation, and help people deal with anxiety and depression.

Unaspiringly, there are hundreds of ASMR app that are compatible with iOS and Android devices you can use to relieve stress whenever you get a chance. We’ve selected some of the best ASMR apps for Android and iOS in order to help you find the one that best fits your needs.

## The Best Relaxation ASMR Apps for Android and iOS

The types of ASMR triggers the app offers, the diversity of its video selection or the quality of the audio are all important factors you will have to consider while choosing the ASMR app. Moreover, some apps enable you to customize the relaxing sounds that help you fall asleep. So, let's take a look at what the best relaxation ASMR apps for Android and iOS have to offer.

### 1\. [TeasEar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/teasear-asmr-slime-simulator/id1439312630)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

Textures can suite your nerves even if they are virtual. TeasEar enables you to simulate a more than a hundred slimy textures. Yogurt, Honey, or Confetti are just a few of the most popular textures you can experiment with, but there are many more available.

The app also lets you interact with each texture you generate, as you just have to place your fingers onto the surface of your Smartphone in order to produce the sound that can potentially trigger the ASMR.

However, the free version of the app grants you access to only a limited amount of triggers and you must purchase a weekly or monthly subscription in order to unlock all the triggers this app has to offer.

### 2\. [Tingles](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tingles-asmr-white-noise/id1181126709)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.designs1290.tingles&hl=en)

If you are looking for an app that can help you overcome insomnia, improve the quality of your sleep, or cope with anxiety then you should try installing Tingles. By doing so you will be able to watch videos from more than 1500 content creators.

The app allows you to listen to the video even when your screen is off, and you can also download content from Tingles and watch it while you are offline. You can browse through thousands of hours of content and choose to watch or listen to the videos that relax you the most. The app also has a sleep timer that ensures you’ll wake up when you want to.

Somnia offers Aubits, continuously blended, and mixed sound bits that can be used to create your own soundscapes.

In addition, Mindwell also combines custom Solfeggio frequencies with custom isochronic tones in order to synchronize with your brainwaves and help you achieve the state of calmness.
