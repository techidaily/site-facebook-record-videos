![choose template and layout](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choose-template1.png)

Canva provides a selection of stock images you can use for free. You can find them by clicking on **Elements** in the menu on the far left, and then clicking on **Free Photos**.

After you have found the image you want to use or loaded it into Canva, click on it and it will appear in your layout.
