![screen recorder vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-recorder-VLC.JPG)

VLC Media Player is a free media player that has a great screen recording feature. You can download it from Video LAN.org. In order to take a screen recording using VLC you first need to click on View and Advanced Controls. A lot of the more advanced features, like screen recording, are initially hidden so as not to confuse users, but selecting Advanced Controls will make them visible. Then you can go to Media and Open Capture Device. In the window that opens choose Desktop next to Capture Mode and click Play. VLC will start displaying your desktop in the player window. Now you just have to click Record.

In the window that pops up click on the arrow next to the Record button and choose a microphone. Then you can press Record. Your recording will not start right away. First, a window will pop up explaining that you can stop your recording by pressing ‘command-control-escape’. Although QuickTime is available for PCs the PC version does not have a screen recording feature.

Unlimited Screen Recorder is also for 5.0 Lollipop and is free with in-app purchases. Like the name ‘Unlimited’ suggests you can use this app to record for as long as you want. There is no time limit. You can also record audio through Unlimited Screen Recorder so it is convenient to make a voiceover for your video.

There are very few options available for recording Android devices older than Lollipop without rooting your device.

QuickTime can be used to record the screen of your iPhone or iPad in addition to the screen of your Mac. First you need to connect your device to your computer with a USB port. Instead of selecting ‘New Screen Recording’ in QuickTime, the way you would when recording your computer screen, select ‘New Movie Recording’. In the recording window click on the arrow next to the ‘Record’ button and choose your iOS device where it asks you to choose a camera. This method only works with the Mac version of QuickTime.
