### **What Monetization Review Entails**

They will review it to make sure it follows all the platform’s policies and guidelines. As the reviews are in progress, creators are encouraged to back to the Earn section of YouTube Studio regularly. Typically, you will get the results within a month, but this may be affected by several factors:

* Application Volumes
* Resource Limitations
* System Issues
* Channel requiring several reviewers to determine suitability for YPP

Sometimes the first application may not be successful for some reason. In this case, creators are encouraged to continue uploading original content and try again after 30 days. For second or other rejections, you are allowed to try again after 90 days. During this period, make sure that your channel follows YouTube policies and guidelines to increase your chances of being accepted.

### **Choose How to Earn**

In the case of Shorts, the ad-sharing revenue involves YouTube sharing the revenue generated from the ads with creators. However, getting accepted to YPP also allows you to start earning with fan funding and Shopping features. This means that creators can earn money directly from their views using these unique features
