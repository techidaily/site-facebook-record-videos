One of the most popular female gamers comes from Liverpool, England. Her first name is Lia and she has been a part of YouTube's gaming community since 2013\. She also uploads videos and vlogs that cover different non-gaming-related topics to her channel on a daily basis.

Lia loves playing Call of Duty, which can be easily deduced from the contents of her channel's homepage, but the long list of games she covered in her videos cover includes Overwatch, Fortnite, or Grand Theft Auto. On May 19\. 2018 SSSniperWolf channel has reached 9 million subscribers.
