Considering this, Google lately came up with a Tik Tok-style app called[YouTube shorts](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)that can be accessed right from your Android or iPhone as long as you are using the YouTube app, and are signed in to your Google account.

That said, in the following sections you will learn everything about the **YouTube Shorts app**, and how it could help you gain more viewers for your YouTube channel.

* **[Part 2: How to Make and Upload a YouTube Shorts Video with Shorts App?](#part2)**
* **[ Part 3: Creating Vertical YouTube Shorts Video in Filmora \[Step by Step Tutorial\] ](#part3)**

---

## **Part 1: What Is YouTube Shorts?**

A short and quick answer to the question is, **YouTube Shorts** is a Tik Tok competitor developed by Google and can be accessed via the YouTube app on an Android or iOS device. In order to use the **YouTube Shorts app**, all you need to do is, sign in to your YouTube account on the YouTube app, and you are good to go.

### 1\. YouTube Shorts Release History

At the time of this writing, **YouTube Shorts** is still in the Beta phase, and there is a lot more that the developers at Google have yet to explore and discover. However, for now, the fully functional variant of the program is available only for users in India on Android and iOS platforms.

### 2\. YouTube Shorts Target Audience

A majority of people who can be called the target audience for YouTube Shorts are the artists and creators looking forward to getting noticed. Some of them could also be among those who wish to become an influencer, or get their YouTube channel more subscribers to be able to become eligible for YouTube Partnership Program.

And of course, the viewers and subscribers cannot be left alone when talking about the target audiences of YouTube Shorts as without them, there’s no point in creating short videos in the first place.

The type of contents that the viewers expect to see as YouTube Shorts could include:

* Entertainment – While movies are of longer duration, roasting the characters in it, or explaining some other stuff to the subscribers could be one of the things that could keep the viewers engaged
* Gaming – Some extraordinary gaming tips, tricks, and skills can be demonstrated in a short video
* How-To – A couple of brief how-to illustrations can yet be another attraction for DIY-loving viewers
* Science and Technology – A short introduction of upcoming gadgets or applications along with their usability can be explained within the timeframe of 60 seconds as well

In addition to the above, a few other categories could be People and Places, Music, Domestic and Wild Animals, Education, etc.

### 3\. YouTube Shorts Content Requirements

While creating **YouTube Shorts**, there are certain guidelines that must be followed. These points include:

* **YouTube Shorts** videos must not be more than 60 seconds long
* The videos must be vertically shot, and must not be in the landscape orientation
* You can have multiple short videos clubbed together. However, the total length of the final video must not exceed 60 seconds in duration
* While posting **YouTube Shorts** videos, the title or the description must contain ‘#shorts’ in it

Certain things that you must keep in mind while creating **YouTube Shorts** include:

* **YouTube Shorts** cannot be monetized. However, they can serve as a good medium to attract and redirect the audiences to your main YouTube channel which may contain several videos that are eligible for monetization.
* The number of views and the total playtime of the **YouTube Shorts** videos DO affect your YouTube channel statistics

### 4\. Where People Can Find YouTube Shorts

As mentioned earlier, **YouTube Shorts** can be accessed by launching the YouTube app on your Android or iOS device. You can use **YouTube Shorts** by clicking the **+** (**Add**) icon present at the bottom. Once the **YouTube Shorts app** is initialized, you can easily create and publish short videos by following the simple on-screen instructions.

## **Part 2: How to Make and Upload a YouTube Shorts Video with Shorts App?**

You can follow the instructions given below to make and [upload a YouTube Shorts](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video using the **YouTube Shorts app**:

**Step 1: Record a Video with YouTube Shorts**

![ Record YouTube Shorts video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-create-youtube-short-video-mobile.jpg)

Launch the YouTube app on your Android or iOS smart device (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is used here for demonstration), make sure that you are signed in to your Google account, tap the **+** (**Add**) button present at the bottom of the screen, tap **Create a Short** on the popup box that appears next, tap the **Record** button on the next window to start the recording. Once you are done, tap the **Stop** button to stop the recording.

**Step 2: Edit the Video**

Tap **Music** from the bottom of the screen to add background music to the video.

However, the audio files that the Music library contains is made available by Google, is royalty-free, and can be used throughout the platform.

![ Edit YouTube Shorts video - Add text and music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-youtube-short-video.jpg)

Likewise, you can tap **Text** to add captions as well. As for the text type, the app offers various formatting options such as alignment (left, center, and right), text highlighter, font changer, and even color selector. Further, the Speed and Timer icons at the top-right area allow you to manage the playback speed anywhere between 0.3x to 3x, and automatically stop the recording after the set time limit respectively. Once everything is set up, tap **NEXT** from the top-right corner to proceed to the next step.

**Step 3: Pick Target Audience Type**

On the **Add details** window, tap **Select audience**, and on the **Select audience** window, tap to select the appropriate radio button to define whether the video is suitable for kids. Tap the **Back** button once the target audience is selected.

**Step 4: Add Details and Upload the Video**

## **Part 3: How to Create a Vertical YouTube Shorts Video in Filmora?**

The **YouTube Shorts app** is pretty convenient to access and use alright. However, it doesn’t allow you to fine edit the videos. The app doesn’t even have many filtering options such as Effects, Elements, etc. to make your videos more engaging.

With that said, you can always use an efficient third-party program like Wondershare Filmora to create professionally-looking **YouTube Shorts** videos to attract your viewers.

When talking about Wondershare Filmora, it is a production and post-production app available for both Windows and Mac computers, and gives tough competition to some of the globally accepted similar programs like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro X, etc. Furthermore, Filmora has its own built-in screen, webcam, and voice recording features that can be used to prepare interactive videos, game walkthroughs, and voiceovers as needed.

Next, you can double-click the preset track in the Timeline to modify the text and make granular modifications to it as needed. Click **OK** to save the changes.

Similarly, you can select the **Effects** and **Elements** tools to add effects and elements to the video as needed. To add background music, you can go to the **Audio** tool, and pick your preferred preset from the available options.
