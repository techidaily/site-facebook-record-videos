There are a lot of things that go into making people watch your videos, but your video thumbnail might be the most important factor.</p><p>Here are 5 easy tips for creating thumbnails that get views.</p><ol><li><strong><a href="#one">Have a Consistent Layout</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#two">Use Your Face</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#three">Use Graphics&#x2F;Emojis That is On Topic</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#four">Make Your Text Huge</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#five">Keep It Clutter-Free!</a></strong></li></ol><p> <em>Contest now closed.</em></p><h2 id="Edit-Your-Videos-Before-Creating-Video-Thumbnails"><a href="#Edit-Your-Videos-Before-Creating-Video-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Edit Your Videos Before Creating Video Thumbnails"></a>Edit Your Videos Before Creating Video Thumbnails</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h2 id="1-Have-a-Consistent-Layout"><a href="#1-Have-a-Consistent-Layout" class="headerlink" title="1. Have a Consistent Layout"></a>1. Have a Consistent Layout</h2><p>Your thumbnails all must look like part of the same set. You want viewers to recognize your videos like yours, and they are more likely to do that if you build up a standard layout that they can start associating with you.</p><p>An example of a standard layout could be you in the middle of the screen wearing an expression that matches the theme of your video, with your title written underneath your face. Every individual thumbnail would still be different, but you and the text would always be in the same spot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/consistent-layout.jpg"                      alt="Consistent Layout"                ></p><h2 id="2-Use-Your-Face"><a href="#2-Use-Your-Face" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Your Face"></a><strong>2. Use Your Face</strong></h2><p>People feel automatically connected and drawn into images that make eye contact. This makes thumbnails which feature faces more click-able than thumbnails which don’t, in most genres (i.e. if you make food videos then this may not apply – featuring the food might be more important than featuring your face). <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check out more tips like this here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Also, if somebody recognizes you in your thumbnail from a previous video of yours, that will go a long way towards making them click.</p><h2 id="3-Use-Graphics-Emojis-that-are-On-Topic"><a href="#3-Use-Graphics-Emojis-that-are-On-Topic" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Graphics&#x2F;Emojis that are On Topic"></a>3. Use Graphics&#x2F;Emojis that are On Topic</h2><p>Anybody can take a screenshot of themselves in their video and use it as a thumbnail. To make your thumbnails look polished, consider using small images (like emojis or hearts) to stand out. This will add color and personality to your thumbnail.</p><p>Make sure the images you choose are relevant to the topic of your video.</p><h2 id="4-Make-Your-Text-Huge"><a href="#4-Make-Your-Text-Huge" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Your Text Huge"></a>4. Make Your Text Huge</h2><p>If you use text in your thumbnail (you don’t have to) then it should be to add context. For example, if the main image is just you smiling then you might need some text to let viewers know the video is a makeup tutorial.</p><p>Thumbnails might look large while you’re putting them together in your image editor, but when they’re displayed on YouTube they’re a lot smaller. That goes double if a viewer is watching on their phone. So, make sure that any text you use is large enough that it can be read easily on small screens.</p><h2 id="5-Keep-it-Clutter-Free"><a href="#5-Keep-it-Clutter-Free" class="headerlink" title="5. Keep it Clutter-Free"></a>5. Keep it Clutter-Free</h2><p>It’s great to add text and emojis to your thumbnails, but you do need to be careful not to add too much. You never want your thumbnails to look cluttered. Viewers should be able to glance at your thumbnails and know exactly what kind of video to expect – that’s difficult to do if there’s too much to process.</p><p>A good rule for text is to use only 1-3 words. That way they won’t clutter your screen, and you can make them large enough to read on small-screened devices.</p><p> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >For even more tips on making great YouTube thumbnails, click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Use these tips to make video thumbnails for YouTube, and tell us what kind of results you get!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-channel-building-through-characters-and-plot-twists/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Channel-Building Through Characters and Plot Twists</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elevate-vlogging-effective-use-of-jump-cuts/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Elevate Vlogging  Effective Use of Jump Cuts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-behind-the-scenes-expert-video-editing-techniques-for-youtubers/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Behind the Scenes  Expert Video Editing Techniques for YouTubers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-core-elements-in-asmr-visual-media/"><u>[Updated] The Core Elements in ASMR Visual Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-vlog-gear-list-17-edition/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Vlog Gear List (#17 Edition)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-efficient-tagging-techniques-to-boost-your-youtube-traffic/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Efficient Tagging Techniques to Boost Your Youtube Traffic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-boosting-views-with-customized-thumbnail-sizes-on-youtube/"><u>[New] In 2024, Boosting Views with Customized Thumbnail Sizes on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/digital-artists-10-favorite-background-switchers/"><u>Digital Artists' 10 Favorite Background Switchers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-embark-into-the-best-youtube-vr-content-ever/"><u>[New] Embark Into the Best YouTube VR Content Ever</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-dslr-streaming-on-personal-devices/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Guide  DSLR Streaming on Personal Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unlocking-secrets-of-sending-mmc-films-to-vimeo/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unlocking Secrets of Sending MMC Films to Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-ipogo-will-be-the-new-ispoofer-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Tecno Pop 8? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-create-an-apple-developer-account-from-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Create an Apple Developer Account From Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-stream-anything-from-xiaomi-redmi-k70-to-apple-tv-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Stream Anything From Xiaomi Redmi K70 to Apple TV | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-brighten-your-surroundings-with-21plus-collage-wonders/"><u>2024 Approved  Brighten Your Surroundings with 21+ Collage Wonders</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Making video viewers enjoy enough that they click on your channel page - that’s hard. Channel art is just about reinforcing the positive feelings viewers have come away from your videos. Anyone who’s looking at your channel art is already thinking about subscribing to you. Your banner should make viewers feel happy with the choice they’ve already half-made.</p><ol><li><a href="#basics">YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics</a></li><li><a href="#resources">Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources</a></li><li><a href="#makers">Free Channel Art Makers</a></li><li><a href="#tips">How to Make Good Channel Art</a></li><li><a href="#inspiration">Channel Art Inspiration</a></li></ol><h2 id="YouTube-Banner-Size-and-Other-Basics"><a href="#YouTube-Banner-Size-and-Other-Basics" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics"></a><strong>YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics</strong></h2><p>YouTube channel art should be 2560 x 1440px.</p><p>As long as you upload an image or background that is that size, viewers looking at your channel on any device will be able to see that you’ve taken the time to personalize your channel page.</p><p>If you want to make a bit more of an impression, you can start thinking about banner dimensions. Depending on what type of screen (laptop, mobile, television) a viewer is visiting your channel on, they will see a different crop of that 2560 x 1440px channel art. That cropped image is your banner.</p><p>Television will display the entire image, but it is significantly smaller on other devices.</p><p>Desktop or laptop computers can show a view as large as 2560 x 423px, or as small as 1546 x 423px.</p><p>Tablets show an area that’s 1855 x 423px.</p><p>Mobile phones show an area that’s 1546 x 423px. This size is also the smallest possible desktop&#x2F;laptop view, and it is considered the ‘safe area.’ Any important text or graphics in your banner should fit within this section, or they could be awkwardly cut off in some views.</p><p>Here’s a visual guide to channel art dimensions:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/channel-art-cheat-sheet.jpg"                      alt="channel-art-cheat-sheet"                ></p><p>Another important detail to consider is the size of your file. YouTube will allow your channel art to have a file size of up to 6MB, but no larger.</p><h2 id="Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-and-Other-Resources"><a href="#Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-and-Other-Resources" class="headerlink" title="Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources"></a><strong>Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of free resources online, which can make the process of designing your channel art simple, including <a href="#templates">templates</a>, <a href="#photos">stock images</a>, <a href="#patterns">backgrounds</a>, and <a href="#fonts">fonts</a>.</p><h4 id="Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates"><a href="#Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Free YouTube Banner Templates"></a><strong>Free YouTube Banner Templates</strong></h4><p>The easiest way to get great channel art might be to find something pre-built you can personalize. There are a few places online you can find something free that will suit both your style and the types of videos you make:</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>filmora.wondershare.com</strong></a></p><p>Here on filmora.io, we have a selection of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >50 free channel art templates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download. The banners are divided into 10 categories representing both different types of YouTube channels (i.e., gaming and beauty) and different popular styles (i.e., minimalist and galaxy), so there’s something for everybody. When you download the free templates, you can choose between PSD files, so you can customize your banner in Photoshop and PNG files you can use with a free online program like Canva (or even Paint on your computer).</p><p><a href="http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/"><strong>Visme</strong></a></p><p>On Visme, you’ll find another 50 free YouTube banners with themes like ‘Rock Star,’ ‘Makeup Tutorial,’ and ‘Cooking Lessons.’ The banners all make use of beautiful high-quality photographs (no patterned backgrounds). You can add your own channel name right on Visme and customize your font&#x2F;color.</p><p><a href="http://yourtubetheme.com/channel-art/"><strong>YourTube</strong></a></p><p>There is a massive amount of resources available on YourTube, which you can download for free. The category labeled templates only has 14 options, but there are really hundreds of options for YouTube channel art. ‘Templates’ just means downloads, which include PSD files where you can edit text. Under ‘All YouTube Channel Art,’ there are over 500 options. Some are patterned backgrounds, some are pictures, but all of them were designed to be channel art. It’s easy to look and imagine where your channel’s name will go.</p><p>There are also a lot of <a href="#makers">Channel Art Makers</a>, which include templates!</p><h4 id="Free-Stock-Images-Backgrounds-and-Fonts"><a href="#Free-Stock-Images-Backgrounds-and-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="Free Stock Images, Backgrounds, and Fonts"></a><strong>Free Stock Images, Backgrounds, and Fonts</strong></h4><p>Sometimes all you need to do is add some text to a really great photo or background pattern. You can find awesome-looking and free options for all three of these things and piece together your own unique channel art.</p><p><strong>Free Stock Photos for YouTube Channel Art</strong></p><p>Unlike templates, stock photos will not already be the exact right size for uploading to YouTube. You’ll have to adjust them, but you don’t need expensive software to do this. You can use a banner maker, or just do some trimming in Paint. While you are making adjustments, <a href="#basics">keep the dimensions</a> from the first part of this article in mind, so important details aren’t partially cut off on some devices.</p><p>There are a lot of beautiful photographs available online, and sites like Stocksy are great if you have the budget available to purchase images. If you need free options, then there are lots of those too, but you do sometimes need to be careful that the way you want to use an image is allowed within the license provided by the site or photographer.</p><p>We recommend these two sites for anybody who finds copyright rules confusing because both of these sites allow you to use their photos for free, for any purpose (commercial or personal), without attribution (although they do appreciate attribution).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-unsplash.jpg"                      alt="free-youtube-banner-unsplash"                ></p><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/"><strong>Unsplash:</strong></a> This site has a huge selection, and more photos are being added all the time. Finding what you want is as easy as typing a keyword (i.e., ‘sunset’) into the search bar on the home page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-pexels.jpg"                      alt="free-youtube-banner-pexels"                ></p><p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/"><strong>Pexels:</strong></a> you can find a wide variety of images on Pexels just by using the search bar on the main page, much like Unsplash. There is actually some overlap in the images available on the two sites, but they also each have photos the other doesn’t, so it’s worth looking at both.</p><h4 id="Free-Background-Patterns-for-YouTube-Banners"><a href="#Free-Background-Patterns-for-YouTube-Banners" class="headerlink" title="Free Background Patterns for YouTube Banners"></a><strong>Free Background Patterns for YouTube Banners</strong></h4><p>Photographs just don’t suit every type of channel. If you don’t think photos of scenery match the style of your channel, you might want to consider a background pattern. Because patterns repeat, you don’t need to worry much about things being cut off when you upload a pattern as channel art (although you’ll still need to make sure any text you add is in the <a href="#basics">safe area</a>).</p><p>One thing you should watch for when using a background pattern is that text can sometimes be hard to read if it’s sitting on top of a busy pattern. You might want to put a box of solid color between your channel name and the pattern.</p><p>The patterns on the following two sites are free to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-the-pattern-library.png"                      alt="free-youtube-banner-the-pattern-library"                ></p><p><a href="http://thepatternlibrary.com/"><strong>The Pattern Library:</strong></a> this truly is a library, and all the patterns were submitted by real graphic designers. When you first arrive on the site, all you’ll see is a randomly selected pattern filling your entire screen. Hovering over the designer’s name in the top left will allow you to download it for free.</p><p>Often, the download will not be as large as the image you see on the site. It will only be a few tiles (or just one tile), and you will need to copy&#x2F;paste it a few times to create a background large enough to use as channel art.</p><p>You can use the navigation tools in the top right of the screen to see more patterns. Clicking the icon that looks like a bunch of squares will allow you to see multiple patterns at once.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-hero-pattern.jpg"                      alt="free-youtube-banner-hero-pattern"                ></p><p><a href="https://www.heropatterns.com/"><strong>Hero Patterns:</strong></a> the patterns on this site are editable before you download. You choose a foreground color, a background color, and the opacity of the design in the foreground. This means that you can make the pattern as subtle or vibrant as you want, which is a great thing to have control over when you’re creating channel art.</p><p>When you choose your custom colors and opacity, every pattern preview on the page will update. You can put in the colors you like for your channel first, and then find a pattern that looks good with them.</p><p>The only downside to Hero Patterns is that downloading your pattern is hard. You actually can’t just download it. Instead, the site generates a code you can embed on a website.</p><p>If you don’t have a website, the easiest thing is probably to use the Snipping Tool (included on all PCs since Vista) to save the preview and then just copy&#x2F;paste it as a tile in a program like Paint or Photoshop.</p><h4 id="Free-Fonts-for-YouTube-Channel-Art"><a href="#Free-Fonts-for-YouTube-Channel-Art" class="headerlink" title="Free Fonts for YouTube Channel Art"></a><strong>Free Fonts for YouTube Channel Art</strong></h4><p>Whatever program you use to build your channel art will already have a selection of fonts. Finding the perfect font to use across your channel art, thumbnails, and for any text, you include in your videos isn’t something you need to think about until your channel is large enough that you’re thinking about your ‘brand’. If you feel like you’re at that stage, or want to get a jump start on it, here are a couple of sites where you can find free fonts and install them on your computer.</p><p><a href="https://www.dafont.com/"><strong>DaFont:</strong></a> there are categories on this site like fancy, gothic, and script, and there are even sub-categories like sci-fi and calligraphy. Licensing limits (whether the font is free and whether it is available for commercial use) will be clearly displayed next to every font. When browsing, you can even type your channel name in where it says ‘Preview’ and see what it will look like in all the different fonts.</p><p><a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/"><strong>Font Squirrel:</strong></a> the nice thing about this site is that everything is guaranteed to be free and available for commercial use. If you scroll down a bit on the main page, you’ll see a toolbar to the right of the screen, which will allow you to narrow down the fonts being displayed by selecting tags like grunge, headings, and casual.</p><p>Once you’ve got an image or images, and maybe even a font you want to use in your banner, you can create your channel art in either a software like Photoshop or a free banner maker (anchor) like the ones below.</p><h2 id="Free-Channel-Art-Makers"><a href="#Free-Channel-Art-Makers" class="headerlink" title="Free Channel Art Makers"></a><strong>Free Channel Art Makers</strong></h2><p>You don’t need an expensive program like Adobe Photoshop to make great channel art. There is a lot of photo editing and graphic design programs available for free online, and most of them are a lot easier to use.</p><p>All three of these sites will allow you to build your banner just by dragging images and text to where you want them, and they even provide premade templates (although those might not be free in some cases).</p><p><a href="https://www.canva.com/"><strong>Canva</strong></a></p><p>Canva is probably the most popular site for creating YouTube banners for free, for a good reason. It’s extremely intuitive for beginners who are making their first graphics, and it’s also a capable enough program to satisfy more intermediate-level users. Canva has stock images, banner templates, and other graphics available, but some of them cost $1 to use. You can also upload your own media instead of relying on Canva’s resources.</p><p>To build channel art in Canva, find ‘YouTube Channel Art’ as one of the options, and you’ll be working with a canvas that’s already the right size. You can also choose from a lot of different layout options, which will divide your canvas into different drop zones for images (pictures will be auto-sized to fit the zone).</p><p>One major <strong>benefit</strong> of Canva is the huge library of stock images, and one <strong>drawback</strong> is that you can’t have multiple images stretched to the end of your canvas.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/"><strong>Wondershare PixStudio:</strong></a></p><p>Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. This online platform empowers anyone to create a beautiful design within a few steps. No professional skills required! By simply dragging and dropping the creative elements and templates, you are capable to release your imagination and convert it to stunning artwork.</p><p>A major <strong>benefit</strong> of PixStudio is that it provides a feature to remove the image background, you can use the image more flexibility. One <strong>drawback</strong> is that the features will be used after payment of $7.99 per month.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ultimate-guide-to-effective-youtube-banners.jpg"                      alt="Wondershare PixStudio Banner Maker"                ></p><p><a href="https://www.designwizard.com/"><strong>Design Wizard</strong></a></p><p>This is another easy to use image editor with templates and stock images, like Canva. You just select YouTube Cover from the options in the Social Media menu (there are also options for YouTube Thumbnails and Profile Pics).</p><p>In Canva, images you drag into your layout will automatically shift to fit the area you put them into. This doesn’t happen in Design Wizard, which can either slow down or speed up your process, depending on which you prefer.</p><p>One major <strong>benefit</strong> of Design Wizard is that it provides you with a ‘safe zone box’ so you can see the smallest view of your channel art while you work. One <strong>drawback</strong> is that the photos in Design Wizard aren’t free, so you’ll either have to buy them or use your own.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> the safe zone box costs $1, so the price of your download will always look like $1 until you delete it when you’re finished designing. Then your price will drop to $0 if you haven’t used any other paid elements.</p><p><a href="https://www.fotor.com/"><strong>Fotor</strong></a></p><p>Fotor works similarly to the other two programs on this list. Just look for ‘YouTube Channel Art’ in the Header &amp; Cover section and click on it to start designing. It does not have layouts like Canva, but it is also a drag-and-drop program, and it is better than Canva if you like to edit with layers.</p><p>Fotor has more free templates than Canva or Design Wizard, although it does also have some premium options. Creating a paid account will allow you to access premium resources and get rid of ads (costs $39.99 for the year), but if all you want it for is to create channel art, a paid account probably isn’t worth it.</p><p>You can upload your own images to use in Fotor as well.</p><p>A major <strong>benefit</strong> of Fotor is that it has a lot of genuinely free channel art templates you can customize, and one <strong>drawback</strong> is that it doesn’t have as many stock photos.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-Good-Channel-Art"><a href="#How-to-Make-Good-Channel-Art" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Good Channel Art"></a><strong>How to Make Good Channel Art</strong></h2><p>Finding an image, cutting it to the right size, and uploading it to YouTube is easy, but how many of your favorite YouTubers use just an image for their channel art? Usually, there’s at least a little text stating the name of the channel.</p><p>In this section, we’ll give you a quick checklist of things to include in your banner (anchor), and some tips on making excellent channel art.</p><h4 id="Channel-Art-Checklist"><a href="#Channel-Art-Checklist" class="headerlink" title="Channel Art Checklist"></a><strong>Channel Art Checklist</strong></h4><p>Here are some things you might want to include in your YouTube banner. Not all of these are right for every type of channel.</p><ol><li>Channel name</li><li>What kinds of videos you make</li><li>Your posting schedule</li><li>Social media handles</li><li>Your face</li><li>A tagline</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-art-layout.jpg"                      alt="YouTube channel art layout"                ></p><h4 id="Top-5-Tips-for-Making-Great-YouTube-Banners"><a href="#Top-5-Tips-for-Making-Great-YouTube-Banners" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Tips for Making Great YouTube Banners"></a><strong>Top 5 Tips for Making Great YouTube Banners</strong></h4><p>Besides looking good, your channel art can help convince more of your viewers to become subscribers. Here are our top 5 tips for making channel art that looks impressive and supports the growth of your channel.</p><ol><li><a href="#solidbackground">Solid Background Behind Text</a></li><li><a href="#minimaltext">Keep Text to a Minimum</a></li><li><a href="#imagesandcolors">Use Images and Colors That Suit Your Channel</a></li><li><a href="#face">Include Your Face</a></li><li><a href="#reason">Give Viewers a Reason To Subscribe</a></li></ol><p><strong>Solid Background Behind Text</strong></p><p>When viewers look at your channel page, you want your name and any other information your banner conveys to jump out at them. It is hard for text to jump out at anybody when it’s competing with a busy background, especially if some of the colors in the background are similar to the color of the text.</p><p>If possible, you can place your text on the part of your background pattern or image where there isn’t much happening behind it. When that isn’t possible, it doesn’t mean you need to find a new background. Instead, insert a solid-colored shape between the text and your background image. Your text will look great, and you won’t have to compromise on a background you like.</p><p><strong>Keep Text to a Minimum</strong></p><p>There is a lot you might want to say in your banner. You’ll want to tell viewers the name of the channel, what kinds of videos you make, when you upload those different kinds of videos, and maybe even the general philosophy driving your channel (i.e., ‘to spread positivity’). That’s all great, but try to say it fast.</p><p>Realistically, viewers probably won’t read more than one line of text. Writing more than that could also force you to use smaller text that viewers will have trouble reading. Ideally, a viewer should absorb all the information in your banner at a glance without having to make the decision to read it.</p><p>Keep your text to your channel name and one additional line underneath, if you can. Make sure your additional line of text is smaller than your channel name, so they aren’t competing.</p><p><strong>Use Images and Colors that Suit Your Channel</strong></p><p>If you have an upbeat, positive, channel then a black and red banner with skulls on it might not be the best choice to convey that. Similarly, if you have a gaming channel, then a minimalist banner that includes an Instagram-worthy picture of you wearing the latest seasonal styles might send the wrong message. It will make the viewer that sees it think you have a lifestyle channel, and they may click away thinking the Let’s Play they just watched was a one-off.</p><p>Look at the kinds of colors and images other YouTubers in your niche are using for inspiration for what you should do, but also consider the unique message of your channel. If you consider yourself bold, use bolder colors. If your videos have a more relaxed vibe, something softer might make sense.</p><p>Here’s a guide to what people tend to associate with different colors:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/color-implication.jpg"                      alt="color-implication"                ></p><p><strong>Include Your Face</strong></p><p>This isn’t essential for every type of channel. If you mostly post gaming content or screencast tutorials and you don’t appear much in your actual videos, there’s no need to appear in your banner.</p><p>However, if your channel is primarily about you as a personality, then including your face in your channel art can have a lot of benefits. People are automatically drawn in by eye contact and feel more connected when they can see a face. Besides just looking good, including your face in your banner can help build a relationship with new viewers and make them feel more comfortable subscribing. They’ll know they’re subscribing to a person, not just a channel.</p><p><strong>Give Viewers a Reason to Subscribe</strong></p><p>Someone who has chosen to check out your channel page is already thinking about subscribing, but they didn’t do it from the video page because they want to know a bit more about you. The things they are probably hoping to find out are:</p><ol><li>Do you have more videos like that one they just watched? Will you make more?</li><li>Are you ever going to post again?</li></ol><p>There are a lot of YouTubers that just give up at some point, or who have started a channel but don’t have time to post very often. That you might never post a new video again, or might not post one for so long that the new subscriber forgets who you are, is a real hesitation viewer can have about subscribing.</p><p>Viewers also want to know that when you do post again, the video you post will be something they like. If they liked the video, they found you through because it was funny, but there’s nothing on your channel page that suggests you do comedy videos regularly, then that can make someone think twice. If you subscribe because of a makeup tutorial, but then the creator only posts personal vlogs from then on, it can be disappointing.</p><p>By clearly stating what kinds of videos you make and when you post them in your banner, you are giving viewers a reason to subscribe.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><p><em>“Vlogs &amp; Comedy! New videos every Tuesday.”</em></p><p><em>“Two videos every week! Makeup Mondays and Fashion Fridays”</em></p><p>If you can create channel art that has a layout that makes sense and sends a clear message even at a glance, then that will help you look like a more experienced YouTuber.</p><h2 id="Channel-Art-Inspiration"><a href="#Channel-Art-Inspiration" class="headerlink" title="Channel Art Inspiration"></a><strong>Channel Art Inspiration</strong></h2><p>Sometimes your niche on YouTube will determine what kinds of channel art you should use. For example, it makes sense for gamers to include game-related graphics in their banners and for travel vloggers to use photos from the destinations they’ve visited.</p><p>However, for lots of YouTube niches, the channel art you make will be built around your personality. How do you know what fits your personality? Here’s some inspiration based on popular trends.</p><p><strong>Minimalism</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-minimalism.jpg"                      alt="text-and-logo-minimalism"                ></p><p>This is an example of a minimalist YouTube banner. This style typically uses only 2 or 3 colors and features clean lines, simple backgrounds, and not a lot of noise. If you want to project a calm, tidy, balanced vibe on your channel, then you should consider going in a minimalist direction with your banner.</p><p>This example is light and airy, but you can also create a minimalist look using brighter or darker colors. It just depends on your personality.</p><p><strong>Galaxy Themed</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-galaxy-themed.jpg"                      alt="text-and-logo-galaxy-themed"                ></p><p>Galaxy banners are exactly what they sound like: channel art featuring space scenes or photographs of the night sky. At first glance, you might think they belong with channels that talk about science or sci-fi, and they are great for that, but they’re also a fun choice for comedy, vlogging, or gaming.</p><p>The great thing about the galaxy style is that it’s cool and different, but it doesn’t take over and distract from your message. There is a lot of room for a space scene to be very personalized. The example above is bold and purple. You can find galaxy photos in just about any color, and they can be either bright like this one or quite dark.</p><p><strong>Funky</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-Funky.jpg"                      alt="text-and-logo-Funky"                ></p><p>There isn’t really one ‘funky’ style. A funky banner is anything that’s just a little off-beat but still makes sense while you’re looking at it. They tend to be bright and cheerful and are perfect for anyone who considers themselves a bit quirky.</p><p>If you’re looking for inspiration for a custom funky banner, go to your closet and find your favorite funny, cute, or ironic t-shirt. There’s probably something in its design you can bring into your channel art.</p><p><strong>Comic</strong></p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-comic.jpg" alt="/text-and-logo-comic"></p><p>A banner featuring an actual comic book character probably belongs to a channel that discusses comics, but the style itself is great for just about anyone.

Even though YouTube Shorts allows users to create videos, it is not a platform that users can engage in communication via instant messaging app. On the other hand, TikTok lets you directly message other users as you share experiences.

But being a standalone app, TikTok still has a chance of scaling the heights. Remember that Shorts is still in the “Beta” version and has not fully exploded even though it’s a built-in app on YouTube.</p><p>TikTok stands a chance of being chosen by many users as it is an independent platform. Users can connect with friends through news feed content or messaging. When it comes to editing tools, the app’s extensive library lets you add presets to your taste. It constantly keeps creators at bay, rolling new filters and effects for the unique creation of content. Additionally, TikTok engages users via its “Q&amp;A” feature where users can pose any hot questions to creators for answers. And beauty is that creators can respond to such comments with a video. More so, you can use the “Discovery” tab to view trending hashtags and sounds, which YouTube Shorts lack.</p><p>With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen.

You get the chance to grow by being introduced to your partner’s audience, you make a friend to support and be supported by as you both grow your channels, and it always looks like a ton of fun. The question isn’t why you should collab, it’s how.</p><p>Finding someone to collab with, approaching them, and figuring out how to actually make the video can be all be challenging. Here are some tips:</p><ol><li><a href="#findingpartners">6 Tips About Finding Collab Partners</a></li><li><a href="#asking">How to Ask Someone to Collab</a></li><li><a href="#videotypes">How to Make a Collab video</a></li><li><a href="#launch">Launching Your Collab</a></li></ol><h2 id="Best-YouTube-Video-Editor–Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Best-YouTube-Video-Editor–Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Best YouTube Video Editor–Wondershare Filmora"></a>Best YouTube Video Editor–Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Wondershare Filmora has all the essential features needed by a PC video editing app like creating slideshows, trimming, merging, cropping, adding background music, rotating videos as well as some special features like APP, motion elements, animated texts, overlays, and filters, etc., and finally, the users can upload their edited video to YouTube directly.

Who Are My Friends?"></a><strong>1. Who Are My Friends?</strong></h4><p>The easiest way to think of a potential collab partner is just to think of who you’re already friendly with. The best place to look for collab partners is probably in your list of subscribers. Someone who already knows what you do and enjoys it will probably be receptive to the idea of doing a video with you.</p><p>You can even sort your own subscribers by their sub counts to find someone with about the same sized channel as you.</p><h4 id="2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me"><a href="#2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me" class="headerlink" title="2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?"></a><strong>2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?</strong></h4><p>You don’t have to already have a friendship, or even a creator-subscriber, relationship with someone to consider them as a potential partner (although it’s not a bad idea to subscribe to them before you send your request).</p><p>Consider people who are in the same niche as you who have approximately the same sized channel as you. If you’re in different genres the collab doesn’t make sense, and if there’s a significant size difference between your channels then it’s a lot more valuable to one of you than the other.</p><h4 id="3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience"><a href="#3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?"></a><strong>3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?</strong></h4><p>Part of why you collaborate is to grow your audience, but that should never be at the expense of your current subscriber base. Before you reach out to a potential collab partner, seriously consider whether you think your audience will enjoy a video that features them.</p><p>Your partner should be someone who delivers content that is relevant to your own audience (for example, it makes no sense for a tech YouTuber to collaborate with someone whose channel is about cupcakes – their techie audience doesn’t want to learn about cupcakes).</p><h4 id="4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos"><a href="#4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Do I Like Their Videos?"></a><strong>4. Do I Like Their Videos?</strong></h4><p>Before you send anyone a message, make sure you’ve watched and enjoyed a few of their videos. If you don’t find them entertaining then your audience probably won’t either. Also, if you don’t seem to have any knowledge of someone’s content then they probably won’t want to work with you.</p><h4 id="5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make"><a href="#5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make" class="headerlink" title="5. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?"></a><strong>5. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?</strong></h4><p>The time to start brainstorming is not after you’ve already sent a collab request. You should think of a few ideas before you reach out, both to show your potential partner that you’re serious and to ensure that your audience is getting well-planned content.</p><h4 id="6-Who’s-in-My-Area"><a href="#6-Who’s-in-My-Area" class="headerlink" title="6. Who’s in My Area?"></a><strong>6. Who’s in My Area?</strong></h4><p>You can do a long-distance collab, but if it is possible to physically meet up with someone to plan and shoot the videos then that’s way better.</p><h2 id="How-to-Ask-Someone-to-Collab"><a href="#How-to-Ask-Someone-to-Collab" class="headerlink" title="How to Ask Someone to Collab"></a><strong>How to Ask Someone to Collab</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/collab-pitch-examples.jpg"                      alt="collab pitch examples"                ></p><p>Here’s an example of a collab pitch, and a template you can use to write your own! It’s from filmora.io’s free YouTube Toolkit, which you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/free-youtube-subscribers" >download with the Get Subs Guide here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Here are some more tips:</p><h4 id="1-Use-Their-Name"><a href="#1-Use-Their-Name" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Their Name"></a><strong>1. Use Their Name</strong></h4><p>This one probably seems basic, but it is very easy to send a message where you just say ‘hey’ and jump to your point without actually using someone’s name. That’s a mistake in this scenario. You want to let your potential partner know that you are specifically interested in working with them and aren’t just fishing for anyone who might work with you.</p><h4 id="2-Mention-Their-Content"><a href="#2-Mention-Their-Content" class="headerlink" title="2. Mention Their Content"></a><strong>2. Mention Their Content</strong></h4><p>Show an interest in your future partner’s videos. You should have watched at least a couple of them as part of deciding to reach out, so mention a video of theirs that you liked and talk about why. Let the other person know that you genuinely enjoy what they do and think your audience will too.</p><h4 id="3-Pitch-Video-Ideas"><a href="#3-Pitch-Video-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="3. Pitch Video Ideas"></a><strong>3. Pitch Video Ideas</strong></h4><p>You should have a couple of ideas for videos you could do together ready when you contact someone. You don’t want to reach out to someone and then seem like you expect them to do all the planning. You may not end up doing one of the ideas you pitch, but you’ll still come off better if you have something in mind when you first send your message.</p><h4 id="4-Keep-Your-Message-Simple"><a href="#4-Keep-Your-Message-Simple" class="headerlink" title="4. Keep Your Message Simple"></a><strong>4. Keep Your Message Simple</strong></h4><p>You don’t want to overwhelm someone with a huge amount of text the first time you contact them. Check out the example at the beginning of this section to get an idea of the length you should go for.</p><h4 id="5-Be-an-Equal"><a href="#5-Be-an-Equal" class="headerlink" title="5. Be an Equal"></a><strong>5. Be an Equal</strong></h4><p>Remember that you are just as wonderful a creator as the person you are approaching. You don’t want to fawn too heavily and cast yourself more as a fan than a serious creator in your own right (not that you can’t be both).</p><h4 id="6-Most-Creators-Have-an-Email-Address-on-Their-Channel-Page"><a href="#6-Most-Creators-Have-an-Email-Address-on-Their-Channel-Page" class="headerlink" title="6. Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page"></a><strong>6. Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page</strong></h4><p>It usually isn’t difficult to find contact information for a YouTuber. If you go to someone’s channel page and click into the About tab, there will usually be a section called ‘For business inquiries’ under ‘Details’. Click ‘View Email Address’ next to that and you’ll have a means of contacting the person you want to collaborate with.</p><p>You can also reach out through DMs or other social media. If you use a platform like Twitter, however, you may want to be a bit more casual and start a conversation before building up to asking them about a collab.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Collab-Video"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Collab-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Collab Video"></a><strong>How to Make a Collab Video</strong></h2><p>Here are 3 ways you can collaborate with other YouTubers.</p><h4 id="Shout-Each-Other-Out"><a href="#Shout-Each-Other-Out" class="headerlink" title="Shout Each Other Out"></a><strong>Shout Each Other Out</strong></h4><p>This is the easiest way to collab because you don’t have to meet up or do much planning together. Essentially, you just make your own video and let everyone know how much you like your partner’s channel (combined with linking your viewers to them), and they do the same.</p><p>Make sure to agree beforehand on how long you’ll spend plugging each other in your videos, so one of you doesn’t go on way longer than the other.</p><p>This probably isn’t a hugely effective method of collaborating if your goal is to grow (I wouldn’t check out someone’s channel just because I was told to), but it certainly is easy.</p><h4 id="Be-Guests-in-Each-Other’s-Videos"><a href="#Be-Guests-in-Each-Other’s-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Be Guests in Each Other’s Videos"></a><strong>Be Guests in Each Other’s Videos</strong></h4><p>This might be the most fun type of collab to watch. The person whose channel the video appears on is the ‘host’ and the video is done in something closer to their usual style (which will be more appealing to their subscribers), and their collab partner is a guest. You might want to do two of these videos so you each have one for your own channel.</p><p> Depending on your YouTube niche, you might do a fun activity together or you might interview your guest about a subject you think your subscribers are interested in.</p><p>In order to pull off a collab like this, you need to be able to meet in person.</p><h4 id="Long-Distance-Collaborations"><a href="#Long-Distance-Collaborations" class="headerlink" title="Long Distance Collaborations"></a><strong>Long Distance Collaborations</strong></h4><p> It’s harder to collab if you can’t meet up, but it isn’t impossible. You can exchange footage to use in each other’s videos, or you can record a Google Hangout or Skype chat.</p><h2 id="Launching-Your-Collab"><a href="#Launching-Your-Collab" class="headerlink" title="Launching Your Collab"></a><strong>Launching Your Collab</strong></h2><p>Here are some tips for making sure both you and your partner get the most out of the collab videos you’ve made.</p><h4 id="Agree-on-a-Launch-Date-Time"><a href="#Agree-on-a-Launch-Date-Time" class="headerlink" title="Agree on a Launch Date&#x2F;Time"></a><strong>Agree on a Launch Date&#x2F;Time</strong></h4><p>If you each have a video for your own channel then you want to make sure those go up at the same time. It’ll be awkward if you post your video and shout out your partner&#x2F;their collab video and when people go to check that out it isn’t up.</p><p>You may want to post your videos as unlisted initially if you’re worried about one of you taking longer to upload. Then, once your videos are both completely ready to go, you can switch their listing to ‘public’ at the exact same time.</p><h4 id="Promote-Your-Collab"><a href="#Promote-Your-Collab" class="headerlink" title="Promote Your Collab"></a><strong>Promote Your Collab</strong></h4><p>Before you post your collab videos, you might want to build hype by mentioning the upcoming collab video in your solo videos leading up to it. If you and your partner are active on platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, you can do things like post behind the scenes pictures of your collab videos to generate excitement.</p><h4 id="Comment-on-Each-Other’s-Videos"><a href="#Comment-on-Each-Other’s-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Comment on Each Other’s Videos"></a><strong>Comment on Each Other’s Videos</strong></h4><p>After you’ve posted your collabs, make sure to leave each other comments about how much fun it was working together. You might want to interact publicly on social media too. Overall, just be friends. You want to maintain this relationship to leave the door open to future collabs, and your viewers will want to believe in your friendship too. Your partner’s subscribers are more likely to be interested in you when they feel like you’re buddies with one of their favorite creators.</p><p> Make sure to discuss how much promotion you’ll each do for the collab before and after it launches. If one of you does a ton of promotion and the other just does one tweet, it won’t make the person who’s done way more promotion feel great.</p><p> Have you ever collaborated on YouTube? If you could collaborate with anyone, who would it be and what kind of video would you make?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-the-monetary-journey-of-ajey-nagar-on-youtube/"><u>[New] The Monetary Journey of Ajey Nagar on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-effortless-and-effective-embedding-youtube-in-gslides-for-2024/"><u>[New] Effortless and Effective - Embedding YouTube in GSlides for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-savor-success-ideas-to-bolster-cookery-channel-brands/"><u>[Updated] Savor Success  Ideas to Bolster Cookery Channel Brands</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-10-leading-flv-to-youtube-video-converters-for-2024/"><u>[New] 10 Leading FLV to YouTube Video Converters for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/youtube-soundwaves-flow-into-imovie-effortlessly-for-2024/"><u>YouTube Soundwaves Flow Into iMovie Effortlessly for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-transform-your-footage-tips-for-youtube-studios-video-editing/"><u>[New] Transform Your Footage  Tips for YouTube Studio's Video Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-secrets-of-successful-youtube-live-games-for-2024/"><u>Unveiling the Secrets of Successful YouTube Live Games for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/youtube-alternatives-at-a-glance-choosing-the-best-platforms-for-2024/"><u>YouTube Alternatives at a Glance  Choosing the Best Platforms for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-guidelines-to-erase-youtube-recordings-on-pc/"><u>[Updated] Guidelines to Erase YouTube Recordings on PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-a-oppo-a79-5g-easily-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Unlock a Oppo A79 5G Easily?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/4-ways-to-unlock-iphone-8-plus-to-use-usb-accessories-without-passcode-by-drfone-ios/"><u>4 Ways to Unlock iPhone 8 Plus to Use USB Accessories Without Passcode</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-unleash-creativity-on-instagram-mastering-bulk-image-and-video-additions-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unleash Creativity on Instagram  Mastering Bulk Image & Video Additions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-from-stills-to-movement-mastery-with-polaroids-latest-tech/"><u>In 2024, From Stills to Movement Mastery with Polaroid's Latest Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-location-on-tiktok-to-see-more-content-on-your-oppo-find-x7-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change Location on TikTok to See More Content On your Oppo Find X7 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-bypassing-icloud-activation-lock-on-iphone-11-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Bypassing iCloud Activation Lock on iPhone 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-audacitys-secret-techniques-for-disentangling-primary-soundscapes-from-background-tracks/"><u>New 2024 Approved Audacitys Secret Techniques for Disentangling Primary Soundscapes From Background Tracks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-immersive-gameplay-capture-roblox-and-macos-synergy/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Immersive Gameplay Capture  Roblox & macOS Synergy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-claim-cost-free-visuals-from-highest-rated-4-youtube-sources-for-2024/"><u>[New] Claim Cost-Free Visuals From Highest-Rated 4 YouTube Sources for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-elevate-your-channels-selecting-prime-microphones-for-every-content-category/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Elevate Your Channels  Selecting Prime Microphones for Every Content Category</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Like 35mm film cameras of the past, DSLR cameras are built with an angled mirror inside its camera body. This mirror allows you to look into your camera’s optical viewfinder and see exactly what your camera sees.</p><p>The mirror inside a DSLR camera flips up out of the way when you open the shutter to allow light to reach the camera’s image sensor.</p><p>Check out our list of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >7 Best DSLR Cameras For Vlogging <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="What-is-a-Mirrorless-Camera"><a href="#What-is-a-Mirrorless-Camera" class="headerlink" title="What is a Mirrorless Camera?"></a>What is a Mirrorless Camera?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-camera.jpg"                      alt="Mirrorless Camera"                ></p><p>Mirrorless cameras are interchangeable lens cameras without a mirror inside the camera body. With nothing to reflect your image, you won’t find any optical viewfinder to look through to see exactly what your camera sees.</p><p>Light passes through the lens of a mirrorless camera and lands directly onto the camera’s sensor.</p><p>Check out our list of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >8 Best Mirrorless Cameras For Vlogging <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-a-Complete-Comparison"><a href="#Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-a-Complete-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Mirrorless vs. DSLR - a Complete Comparison"></a>Mirrorless vs. DSLR - a Complete Comparison</h2><h4 id="Size-and-Weight"><a href="#Size-and-Weight" class="headerlink" title="Size and Weight"></a>Size and Weight</h4><p>DSLR cameras are larger and heavier than mirrorless cameras because there are more parts that go into their camera bodies. DSLR cameras require enough space inside for an angled mirror to flip up out of the way.</p><p>If your video shooting style is more on-the-go, like that of a daily vlogger or travel vlogger, the smaller size and lighter weight of a mirrorless camera may be more suitable for you.</p><h4 id="Previewing-Images"><a href="#Previewing-Images" class="headerlink" title="Previewing Images"></a>Previewing Images</h4><p>When you’re using a DSLR camera, your optical viewfinder will show you exactly what your camera sees as opposed to a digital preview of what your image sensor picks up. No matter how bright or dark your scene actually is, through the optical viewfinder, you’ll be able to clearly see what your camera sees with the power of your eye.</p><p>Mirrorless cameras, on the other hand, display on your camera’s screen or electronic viewfinder a digital preview of what your camera is looking at. You will notice a lag, especially in low light, between actions that are taking place in front of the camera and the same actions being displayed in your live preview.</p><h4 id="Lenses-and-Accessories"><a href="#Lenses-and-Accessories" class="headerlink" title="Lenses and Accessories"></a>Lenses and Accessories</h4><p>Having been around much longer, there are plenty more options for lenses and accessories when it comes to shooting with DSLR cameras. You can choose from all kinds of different quality levels and price ranges.</p><h4 id="Video-Resolution"><a href="#Video-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Video Resolution"></a>Video Resolution</h4><p>4K video recording is more readily available in mirrorless cameras than DSLR cameras. At a much more affordable budget, you can get your hands on a 4K mirrorless camera. If you want to shoot 4K video on a DSLR camera, though, you will have to pay for some of the most expensive DSLR cameras on the market.</p><h4 id="Image-Stabilization"><a href="#Image-Stabilization" class="headerlink" title="Image Stabilization"></a>Image Stabilization</h4><p>Up until quite recently, you needed to get the right lens with built-in optical image stabilization if you wanted to shoot stabilized photos and videos with an interchangeable lens camera. Image stabilization had not been readily available in the bodies of these cameras.</p><p>In recent years, however, mirrorless cameras have been much more active in their development of camera bodies equipped with shifting image sensors. Your shots can be even more stabilized when the optical image stabilization of your lens is combined with your camera’s in-body sensor-shift image stabilization.</p><h4 id="Battery-Life"><a href="#Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life"></a>Battery Life</h4><p>When it comes to shooting video, DSLR cameras and mirrorless cameras consume about the same amount of power. It’s still safe to say, though, that DSLR cameras, for the most part, have better battery life than mirrorless cameras because their bigger batteries are packed with more power.</p><h2 id="Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-Which-One-is-Better-for-Video"><a href="#Mirrorless-vs-DSLR-Which-One-is-Better-for-Video" class="headerlink" title="Mirrorless vs. DSLR - Which One is Better for Video?"></a>Mirrorless vs. DSLR - Which One is Better for Video?</h2><p>In my opinion, when it comes to filming a video, mirrorless cameras are the way to go.

Think of ‘Trending’ as Relevant"></a><strong>1. Think of ‘Trending’ as Relevant</strong></h2><p>Instead of thinking of a trending video as a video that everyone is doing, think of it as a subject that is relevant to a lot of people. You want to cover topics that a lot of people care about.</p><p>A lot of YouTubers see huge channels have a lot of success posting videos that are very focused on the personal life of the creator (i.e. ‘I had the WORST day’) or which have very vague or sensational titles (i.e. ‘The horse knows what it did’) and decide that those are the kinds of videos they want to do too. However, the only reason large channels are able to be successful with these kinds of videos and titles is that they are already big. These creators have already grown themselves huge audiences of people who know and are interested in them personally.</p><p>As a smaller creator, you will not be successful if you only aim to do videos that are focused on you and your life. For example, if you have 100 subscribers and make a vlog about how your day went, then you have 100 people who may potentially find that interesting. The content might be good, but it won’t help you grow.</p><h2 id="2-Find-Trending-Topics-Within-Your-Niche-2"><a href="#2-Find-Trending-Topics-Within-Your-Niche-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

Every genre on YouTube has its own trends, and you will often know about them just by virtue of watching other channels in your genre and talking to people who are interested in the same things as you. For example, if you’re a Gamer and your friends are also Gamers then you probably already know what Gamers are currently interested in.</p><p>If you do need help determining trends, here are 2 ways to do it:</p><ol><li>Visit 3 of the most popular channels in your genre (i.e. gaming, beauty, or prank) and see if there’s any overlap in the themes of their most recent videos.</li><li>Go to <a class="link"   href="https://trends.google.ca/trends/" >Google Trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and look at the categories most relevant to your genre. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >To learn how to use Google Trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li></ol><h2 id="3-Aim-for-Number-1-2"><a href="#3-Aim-for-Number-1-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

It has ironical expressions that give the song its speciality. These songs are different when it comes to different singers or different artists. This is because every artist has their style and speciality which they include while composing their Parody songs. It can even be in the form of general style music.</p><p>Parody culture was first recognized in the 14th century and it has been named as one of the most artistically expressed devices.</p><p>There are various types of Parodies’,</p><ul><li>Film Parody</li><li>Poetic Parody</li><li>Self- Parody</li></ul><p>Parody is more frequently used when it comes to political announcements in the U.S.A.</p><p>Parody is in no way, shape or form fundamentally ironical, and may some of the time be finished with deference and energy about the subject in question, without being a remiss snide assault.</p><p>It is also used as a communicative dialogue bridge between cultures or at times subcultures.</p><p>Each endeavor at a Parody isn’t made similarly as a satire, and in each occurrence, the specific farce would need to experience the four-factor reasonable use examination to decide if it establishes a reasonable use.</p><p>In later occasions, the term melodic parody came to connote the hilarious utilization of new messages to previous vocal pieces, just as both genuine and amusing references to specific melodic styles</p><p> <strong>Top 10 Parody Songs:</strong></p><ul><li>Amish paradise</li></ul><p>“Weird Al” Yankovic has his style when it comes to composing Parody songs. He raps the everyday difficulties faced by people in a Humorous way. The thing which most caught my eye was the fact that the surroundings were made simple but the song has its way of making one crack up with laughter. Having around 4 decades of experience in Music Yankovic was one of the most famous composers of his time. People found it lucky to have their songs Parodied down by him.</p><ul><li>I gotta feeling- College Humour:</li></ul><p>Back in the days, this was one of the most popular Parody. It got a few dazzling feedbacks which made teenagers go crazy on the song. Its lyrics define how the frat parties at colleges end up with hangovers and some hazy memories of them logging out from the world. With his cell phones and a very few clues how a drunk guy figures out what happened the night of the party is what the whole song is about.</p><ul><li>White and Nerdy:</li></ul><p>“Weird Al,” Yankovic wrote this song. It revolves around the lines that a Man ‘can’t roll with the gangsters’ because he is too ‘White and Nerdy’.</p><p>This refers to all the Nerds out there who are more concerned about computer programs, Video games, Comics, Fancy dresses like superman or watching the Stars wars movies hundreds of times. This is one of the biggest hits of the century and was considered to be one of the funniest songs ever made.</p><ul><li>She was beautiful, I swear:</li></ul><p>The Parody by Kevin sage revolves around the topic that he sees a girl on a subway but how she turned out to be a man. It starts by him swearing that he thought she was a girl, but as you all guessed reality was something much more hilariously colourful. He was too drunk to differentiate between a man and a woman. But well, it is too late to face the truth, isn’t it?</p><ul><li>Look at this Instagram- College Humour:</li></ul><p>It revolves around how the social App Instagram is used. It is used to make other people jealous of how awesome your life. At least that is how Nickelback portrays it to be. The way her picture is so cute or the food she ate is delicious. The fact that her vacation at the beach was magnificent or the dress she bought was beautiful is how the whole song is written to be. Instagram users are made fun of in a harmless way about how they seem obsessed with their puppies or kittens.</p><ul><li>Tacky:</li></ul><p>“Weird Al,” Yankovic describes the song about how tacky he is, or how he seems to eat food out of Instagram (Ironically of course). He talks about how he wears his sandals with socks or how he wears his belt with suspenders. It is a weirdly satisfying song.</p><ul><li>Fat:</li></ul><p>“Weird Al,” Yankovic wrote this song describes how fat a man is. He used Michael Jacksons song to make a Parody and this wasn’t the first time he did that. This video won the Grammy award for being the Best Concept Music Video ever. The video starts with a fat man walking and singing out all the problems he faces because of being fat.</p><ul><li>Telephone:</li></ul><p>A very famous and brilliant song. The video starts with the dialogue, “Will you tell me the concept of this telephone video or not’. This revolves around Lady Gaga. Maybe her weird costumes or her quirkiness.</p><ul><li>Gangnam style:</li></ul><p>Let’s face it, it is the most popular Parody which almost every citizen from the whole world had heard. Bark Baker has around 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube just because of this song. The most hilarious and also musically sound video which took over the entire industry with its massive hit.</p><ul><li>A complicated song:</li></ul><p>Another, massive hit by the famous “Weird Al,” Yankovic. This music video is divided into three parts. Each of them describing one of the weirdest situations the composer finds himself in. One revolves around too much pizza, the second one around the girl he loved but the fact that she was going to propose his cousin and the third one is about he almost knocked off this head while standing on a roller coaster ride.</p><p> Other famous Parody songs,</p><ul><li>Somebody that I used to know</li><li>Lose yourself</li><li>A lot</li><li>Friday</li><li>Poker face</li><li>Call me maybe</li><li>Hello</li><li>Beat it</li><li>Hooked on polkas</li><li>Boom Boom Pow</li><li>Party in the U.S.A</li><li>She’s always a woman</li><li>Best song ever</li><li>New rules</li><li>I’m a believer</li><li>All about that Bass</li><li>Tic Tok</li><li>Humble</li><li>I want a new Duck</li><li>Rehab</li><li>Blurred lines</li><li>Can’t feel my face</li></ul><p> Basics on how to make a Parody video:</p><p> Tips,</p><ul><li>Outline the structure of the song you want to write</li></ul><p>It is essential to pen down your ideas and structure it first instead of directly jumping to the finale. It can be done by putting down your primary theme at the top of the page and then penning the sub-themes. Try to simplify the meaning. Make note of all the important stuff.</p><ul><li>Try matching all the syllables</li></ul><p>Match the syllables of the Parody with the lyrics of the original composition. This is what gives the song its flavour. Start by counting the number of syllables in both the versions and try matching them as much as you can to give the same feel.</p><ul><li>Be active</li></ul><p>Don’t be lazy. Think and rethink all your ideas. Start looking for inspiration around you. Keep your mind active at all times. Who knows, something might strike you when you least expect it.</p><ul><li>Use the Thesaurus tool</li></ul><p>Make use of the internet and the tools it provides to beautify your work.</p><ul><li>Try speaking the words out loud</li></ul><p>Language can be confusing. Avoid that by speaking out loud before finalizing. This is found to be much more productive than just thinking about them in your mind.</p><ul><li>Edit and re-edit it</li></ul><p>Don’t ever submit the first draft. Edit it again and again and present the best version of it to the world.</p><ul><li>Refine the song at last</li></ul><p>Try talking about it with your family and ask them how it can be modified. Be open to suggestions and refine it as much as you can.</p><p> And voila, you have the best Parody music.</p><p> Conclusion:</p><p> A Parody is a work that is made by copying a current unique work to ridicule or remark on a part of the first. The most punctual realized spoof masses date from the late fourteenth century and the technique got basic in the fifteenth and sixteenth 100 of years. Parody, in music, initially the inventive adjusting of a few voice portions of a prior synthesis to frame another organization, as often as possible a mass; in present-day melodic use, spoof, as a rule, alludes to the comical impersonation of a genuine piece.</p><p>Spoofs can target VIPs, government officials, creators, a style or pattern, or some other intriguing subject.</p><p>Parody is significant because it permits us to condemn and address without being forceful or noxious. Or maybe, we use satire.</p><p>Few famous Parody singers, makers or Industries:</p><ul><li>Ellen DeGeneres</li><li>Weird Al Yankovic</li><li>College Humour</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-broadcast-brilliance-with-cost-effective-templates-for-2024/"><u>[New] Broadcast Brilliance with Cost-Effective Templates for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-understanding-legal-bounds-of-youtube-video-screencaps/"><u>[Updated] Understanding Legal Bounds of YouTube Video Screencaps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-key-to-profit-youtube-shorts-insights/"><u>[Updated] The Key to Profit  YouTube Shorts Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-crafting-timeless-videos-with-retro-filmmaking-skills-for-2024/"><u>[New] Crafting Timeless Videos with Retro Filmmaking Skills for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-cutting-edge-8-content-creators-skyrocketing-growth/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Cutting-Edge 8 Content Creators Skyrocketing Growth</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-a-comprehensive-walkthrough-for-imovie-and-youtube-collaboration-for-2024/"><u>[New] A Comprehensive Walkthrough for iMovie and YouTube Collaboration for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-cultivating-cash-by-critiquing-consumer-commodities-online-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Cultivating Cash by Critiquing Consumer Commodities Online for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/ultimate-speaker-change-tech-for-internet-showbiz-pros/"><u>Ultimate Speaker Change Tech for Internet Showbiz Pros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-streamlining-speaker-audio-in-microsoft-powerpoint-cross-platform-solutions-for-windows-and-mac/"><u>New 2024 Approved Streamlining Speaker Audio in Microsoft PowerPoint Cross-Platform Solutions for Windows and Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-5-simple-steps-to-upping-your-mac-cam-game/"><u>[New] 5 Simple Steps to Upping Your Mac Cam Game</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-10-best-listed-playlists-on-spotify/"><u>[New] 10 Best-Listed Playlists on Spotify</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-earning-estimates-for-youtube-creators-adsense-pay-out-per-1000-viewers/"><u>2024 Approved  Earning Estimates for YouTube Creators  AdSense Pay-Out per 1,000 Viewers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-samsung-galaxy-a05-bootloader-easily-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Samsung Galaxy A05 Bootloader Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-peak-players-choice-selecting-the-top-7-fps/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Peak Players' Choice  Selecting the Top 7 FPS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-angles-of-perspective-youtubes-path-to-dynamic-video-editing/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Angles of Perspective  YouTube's Path to Dynamic Video Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-steps-on-how-to-create-a-new-apple-id-account-on-apple-iphone-11-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Easy Steps on How To Create a New Apple ID Account On Apple iPhone 11 | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Choosing the right ones at the right moment will help you grow much faster.</p><p>Knowing this, how do you know the perfect hashtags for YouTube?</p><p>The answer is simple. This guide lets you know precisely how to discover the best hashtags for YouTube. In addition, you’ll learn what tools to use and how to always find the correct tag for each video.</p><ol><li><a href="#">Keyword Tool</a></li><li><a href="#">TubeBuddy Chrome Extension</a></li><li><a href="#">VidIQ Chrome Extension</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Bonus: Edit Your Vlog Videos Like A Pro With Filmora</a></li></ul><h2 id="Best-YouTube-Vlog-Hashtags"><a href="#Best-YouTube-Vlog-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="Best YouTube Vlog Hashtags"></a>Best YouTube Vlog Hashtags</h2><p>Hashtags are powerful features that can connect the right viewer to your content. They merge videos and viewers with similar topics and interests.</p><p>If you have a vlog on YouTube, there is a set of hashtags that work perfectly with this type of content.</p><p>This is a list that might help:</p><ul><li>#vloggingmylife</li><li>#vlogginggear</li><li>#vloggerlife</li><li>#vloggers</li><li>#vloglife</li><li>#vlogger</li><li>#vlogging</li><li>#youtuber</li><li>#vlogs</li><li>#dailyvlog</li><li>#vloggingcamera</li><li>#vloging</li><li>#vloggingcommunity</li><li>#vloggerlifestyle</li><li>#travelvlogging</li><li>#vloggingmum</li><li>#foodvlogging</li><li>#vlogginglife</li><li>#newtovlogging</li><li>#disneyvlogging</li><li>#vlogging101</li><li>#vloggingsetup</li><li>#vloggingfamily</li><li>#vlogday</li><li>#kidsvlogging</li><li>#imvlogginghere</li><li>#beautyvlogging</li><li>#microvlogging</li><li>#motovlogging</li><li>#instavlogging</li></ul><p>When using hashtags for YouTube, it’s essential to put yourself in your viewers’ shoes. So first, ask yourself what your ideal viewer is searching for.</p><p>For example, if you’re creating a video on how to cook past, think about all the ways the viewer would search for this on YouTube. A few hashtags may come to mind are #pastarecipes, #pastacooking, #tasypasta, and so on. I hope you get the idea of how hashtags work.</p><p>This may take a lot of time. However, a YouTube hashtag generator can make this process a lot quicker and even more effective.</p><h2 id="Best-Tools-for-YouTube-Vlog-Hashtags"><a href="#Best-Tools-for-YouTube-Vlog-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="Best Tools for YouTube Vlog Hashtags"></a>Best Tools for YouTube Vlog Hashtags</h2><p>You should know that more than these thirty hashtags will be needed to help your videos succeed. But sometimes, you will need better or more appropriate ones.</p><p>The best way to always have the perfect tags is to use a YouTube hashtags generator. It’s a tool that digs up the ideal tags for every type of video.</p><p>Here are the three best YouTube hashtag generators you can use:</p><h3 id="1-Keyword-Tool"><a href="#1-Keyword-Tool" class="headerlink" title="1 Keyword Tool"></a>1 Keyword Tool</h3><p>This tool’s primary purpose may be to help with keyword research, but it has a valuable hashtag extension.</p><p>First, type in the topic of your video. For example, “vlog.” Hit Search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-keyword-tool.jpg"                      alt="youtube hashtag generator"                ></p><p>Then, select the Hashtags panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/hashtag-panel.jpg"                      alt="youtube hashtag tool"                ></p><p>This will show you a massive list of trending hashtags you can use for your YouTube video. However, the YouTube tags it gives you will sometimes be different. For example, if you search for the same word at another time, the results may differ depending on current trends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-hashtags.jpg"                      alt="list of tags for youtube"                ></p><p>That’s all there is to it. Copy any tags you like and use them for your video. Also, you can purchase the pro version of this tool to get more detailed insights. However, the free version works just fine most of the time. The choice is yours.</p><h3 id="2-TubeBuddy-Chrome-Extension"><a href="#2-TubeBuddy-Chrome-Extension" class="headerlink" title="2 TubeBuddy Chrome Extension"></a>2 TubeBuddy Chrome Extension</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/tubebuddy.jpg"                      alt="tubebuddy chrome extension"                ></p><p>TubeBuddy is a Chrome extension that does much more for your YouTube channel than help with hashtags.

It’s all the little things combined that help you get more viewers. Things like using the right keywords, thumbnails, YouTube tags, etc.</p><p>Yet, it would help if you didn’t forget the most important thing: the video itself. So, give Filmora a try and become surprised by how easy it is to create a high-quality YouTube video.</p><p>Best YouTube Vlog Hashtags</p><p>Hashtags are powerful features that can connect the right viewer to your content. They merge videos and viewers with similar topics and interests.</p><p>If you have a vlog on YouTube, there is a set of hashtags that work perfectly with this type of content.</p><p>This is a list that might help:</p><ul><li>#vloggingmylife</li><li>#vlogginggear</li><li>#vloggerlife</li><li>#vloggers</li><li>#vloglife</li><li>#vlogger</li><li>#vlogging</li><li>#youtuber</li><li>#vlogs</li><li>#dailyvlog</li><li>#vloggingcamera</li><li>#vloging</li><li>#vloggingcommunity</li><li>#vloggerlifestyle</li><li>#travelvlogging</li><li>#vloggingmum</li><li>#foodvlogging</li><li>#vlogginglife</li><li>#newtovlogging</li><li>#disneyvlogging</li><li>#vlogging101</li><li>#vloggingsetup</li><li>#vloggingfamily</li><li>#vlogday</li><li>#kidsvlogging</li><li>#imvlogginghere</li><li>#beautyvlogging</li><li>#microvlogging</li><li>#motovlogging</li><li>#instavlogging</li></ul><p>When using hashtags for YouTube, it’s essential to put yourself in your viewers’ shoes. So first, ask yourself what your ideal viewer is searching for.</p><p>For example, if you’re creating a video on how to cook past, think about all the ways the viewer would search for this on YouTube. A few hashtags may come to mind are #pastarecipes, #pastacooking, #tasypasta, and so on. I hope you get the idea of how hashtags work.</p><p>This may take a lot of time. However, a YouTube hashtag generator can make this process a lot quicker and even more effective.</p><h2 id="Best-Tools-for-YouTube-Vlog-Hashtags-1"><a href="#Best-Tools-for-YouTube-Vlog-Hashtags-1" class="headerlink" title="Best Tools for YouTube Vlog Hashtags"></a>Best Tools for YouTube Vlog Hashtags</h2><p>You should know that more than these thirty hashtags will be needed to help your videos succeed.

For example, “vlog.” Hit Search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-keyword-tool.jpg"                      alt="youtube hashtag generator"                ></p><p>Then, select the Hashtags panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/hashtag-panel.jpg"                      alt="youtube hashtag tool"                ></p><p>This will show you a massive list of trending hashtags you can use for your YouTube video. However, the YouTube tags it gives you will sometimes be different.

In certain instances, a good YouTube presence could make or break a business or budding entertainment sensation.</p><p>Those with high YouTube rankings typically yield more returns from the said venue. Luckily, users might increase these vital statistics by paying close attention to several factors that affect YouTube video ranking.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p><a href="#part1">Factors that Affect YouTube Video Ranking</a></p><p><a href="#part2">Top 8 YouTube Rank Tracker</a></p><h2 id="Factors-that-Affect-YouTube-Video-Ranking"><a href="#Factors-that-Affect-YouTube-Video-Ranking" class="headerlink" title="Factors that Affect YouTube Video Ranking"></a>Factors that Affect YouTube Video Ranking</h2><p>If you are a YouTuber, you have to understand how videos rank higher. In turn, this will allow you to ensure your content appears in top search results more often. With that in mind, here are some factors that affect your YouTube ranking.</p><h4 id="Video-Title"><a href="#Video-Title" class="headerlink" title="Video Title"></a>Video Title</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-1.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking"                ></p><p>YouTube videos number in the many millions. Therefore, users enjoy a significant deal of variety when choosing which ones to view. YouTubers may yield a more favorable ranking by creating a catchy title.</p><p>On-page YouTube ranking optimization is crucial if you want to get a higher video ranking. Metadata is one of the YouTube ranking factors; this includes your video title. Essentially, titles give the first impression of any video to end users, YouTube, and search engines.</p><p>A well-titled video attracts more traffic, which translates to more views. Experts recommend using short titles that immediately get to the meat and potatoes of what the video entails. Avoid long titles as some devices, browsers, and search engines can cut them off.</p><p>Video titles should have five words or less. Don’t forget to place keywords at the beginning of the title. The keywords should also be relevant to your video.</p><h4 id="Video-Description"><a href="#Video-Description" class="headerlink" title="Video Description"></a>Video Description</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-2.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking - video description"                ></p><p>When many videos on the same or similar topics exist, content can seem repetitive to prospective viewers. Therefore, YouTubers should offer a short but detailed description of the information contained within. And above all, address how their video stands out from similar content.</p><p>Because Google and YouTube cannot extract information from videos, they use text descriptions to define the content on videos. Therefore, if you do not include a description, search engines won’t know what your video is about: this might affect your ranking.</p><p>Make sure your video description is 250 words or more. Additionally, include relevant and suitable keywords.</p><p>When writing the description, you can place the main keyword in your first 25 words and then link to external URLs; for instance, you could link to related blog content or your social media channels.</p><h4 id="Video-Quality"><a href="#Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Video Quality"></a>Video Quality</h4><p>Poor quality is an immediate buzz kill. Few people can bear to watch a video with poor sound or picture quality. In many instances, quality is one of the YouTube ranking factors. HD (high-definition) videos rank higher than lower-quality ones. YouTube often highlights HD videos in its top search results.</p><p>Filmora can help you improve the quality of your videos, which will make them rank higher. The software allows you to edit your video and change its hue, brightness, saturation, and contrast. You can also crop, cut, and trim your videos.</p><p>What’s more? Filmora allows you to adjust output volume, pitch, fade-in, and fade-out to make your video clear. Once you have finished creating your HD video, you can head to the Export tab and select Upload to YouTube to publish your video on your channel.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h4 id="Watch-Time"><a href="#Watch-Time" class="headerlink" title="Watch Time"></a>Watch Time</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-4.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking - watch time"                ></p><p>Watch Time is also among the YouTube ranking factors. According to YouTube, Watch Time is the total length of time people spend watching your videos.</p><p>YouTube’s algorithm prioritizes videos leading to longer viewing sessions over the ones with more views. You can use Audience Retention Report and YouTube Analytics Views Report to find out which videos have the worst and best view times. Doing this will allow you to plan for your future content accordingly</p><p>Using annotations and leaving links to other videos in your description box can help you increase the length of your viewing sessions.</p><h4 id="Thumbnails"><a href="#Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Thumbnails"></a>Thumbnails</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-5.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Thumbnails"                ></p><p>Thumbnails have a positive effect on click-through rates when used the right way. You can use them to maximize your views and YouTube video ranking.</p><p>YouTube generates thumbnails by taking screenshots from videos. However, you might want to go for customized thumbnails, as this will allow you to stand out from your competitors and outperform their videos.</p><p>Make sure the image you use as your thumbnail is aesthetically pleasing and grabs the attention of viewers. Also, it should be relevant to the content in your video. Keep in mind that thumbnails with a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1280-by-20-pixel resolution generally perform best.</p><h4 id="Number-of-Views"><a href="#Number-of-Views" class="headerlink" title="Number of Views"></a>Number of Views</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-6.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Number of Views"                ></p><p>Views are a vital YouTube ranking factor, as people are more likely to watch videos with a high number of views. The more views your video has, the higher it will rank, especially for competitive keywords.</p><p>If you want to rank high for competitive keywords, ensure that your videos get loads of views. For this reason, you have to take steps and get your video content on other platforms. In turn, you will increase the visibility of your videos and view count.</p><p>You could embed your videos into your blog posts or share them on social media platforms to get more people to watch them.</p><h4 id="Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles"><a href="#Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Closed Captions and Subtitles"></a>Closed Captions and Subtitles</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-7.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Closed Captions and Subtitles"                ></p><p>Adding captions to videos with spoken-word content can improve your YouTube video ranking. Essentially, it opens up your videos to a larger audience, including people who are deaf and anyone speaking a different language from the one in your videos. Search engines also crawl close captions, which can boost your rankings.</p><p>While YouTube offers automatic captioning, it is not perfect. So you may need to make some edits or upload the captions yourself.</p><h2 id="How-to-Optimize-Your-YouTube-Ranking"><a href="#How-to-Optimize-Your-YouTube-Ranking" class="headerlink" title="How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking"></a>How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking</h2><h4 id="Focusing-on-User-Engagement"><a href="#Focusing-on-User-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="Focusing on User Engagement"></a>Focusing on User Engagement</h4><p>One of the best YouTube ranking optimization practices that you can implement is asking users to leave comments, like your videos, and share them.

Use related hashtags when creating your descriptions to ensure people find your videos when searching for specific hashtags.</p><p>Tags help drive search because they make main trends more visible. After adding a hashtag to the description, it will appear above the video title, and viewers will see it hyperlinked.</p><h4 id="Categorizing-Your-Video"><a href="#Categorizing-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Categorizing Your Video"></a>Categorizing Your Video</h4><p>After uploading your video, you should categorize it by going to Advanced settings.

According to YouTube, Watch Time is the total length of time people spend watching your videos.</p><p>YouTube’s algorithm prioritizes videos leading to longer viewing sessions over the ones with more views. You can use Audience Retention Report and YouTube Analytics Views Report to find out which videos have the worst and best view times. Doing this will allow you to plan for your future content accordingly</p><p>Using annotations and leaving links to other videos in your description box can help you increase the length of your viewing sessions.</p><h4 id="Thumbnails-3"><a href="#Thumbnails-3" class="headerlink" title="Thumbnails"></a>Thumbnails</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-5.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Thumbnails"                ></p><p>Thumbnails have a positive effect on click-through rates when used the right way. You can use them to maximize your views and YouTube video ranking.</p><p>YouTube generates thumbnails by taking screenshots from videos. However, you might want to go for customized thumbnails, as this will allow you to stand out from your competitors and outperform their videos.</p><p>Make sure the image you use as your thumbnail is aesthetically pleasing and grabs the attention of viewers. Also, it should be relevant to the content in your video. Keep in mind that thumbnails with a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1280-by-20-pixel resolution generally perform best.</p><h4 id="Number-of-Views-3"><a href="#Number-of-Views-3" class="headerlink" title="Number of Views"></a>Number of Views</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-6.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Number of Views"                ></p><p>Views are a vital YouTube ranking factor, as people are more likely to watch videos with a high number of views. The more views your video has, the higher it will rank, especially for competitive keywords.</p><p>If you want to rank high for competitive keywords, ensure that your videos get loads of views. For this reason, you have to take steps and get your video content on other platforms. In turn, you will increase the visibility of your videos and view count.</p><p>You could embed your videos into your blog posts or share them on social media platforms to get more people to watch them.</p><h4 id="Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles-3"><a href="#Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles-3" class="headerlink" title="Closed Captions and Subtitles"></a>Closed Captions and Subtitles</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-7.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Closed Captions and Subtitles"                ></p><p>Adding captions to videos with spoken-word content can improve your YouTube video ranking. Essentially, it opens up your videos to a larger audience, including people who are deaf and anyone speaking a different language from the one in your videos. Search engines also crawl close captions, which can boost your rankings.</p><p>While YouTube offers automatic captioning, it is not perfect. So you may need to make some edits or upload the captions yourself.</p><h2 id="How-to-Optimize-Your-YouTube-Ranking-3"><a href="#How-to-Optimize-Your-YouTube-Ranking-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking"></a>How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking</h2><h4 id="Focusing-on-User-Engagement-3"><a href="#Focusing-on-User-Engagement-3" class="headerlink" title="Focusing on User Engagement"></a>Focusing on User Engagement</h4><p>One of the best YouTube ranking optimization practices that you can implement is asking users to leave comments, like your videos, and share them. YouTube analyzes these metrics to determine the quality of your content. Ergo, if YouTube sees your video is engaging users, it will rank higher than those with little or no engagement.</p><h4 id="Using-Video-Hashtags-3"><a href="#Using-Video-Hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="Using Video Hashtags"></a>Using Video Hashtags</h4><p>Hashtags help people to find content that provides answers to their questions across various platforms. Use related hashtags when creating your descriptions to ensure people find your videos when searching for specific hashtags.</p><p>Tags help drive search because they make main trends more visible. After adding a hashtag to the description, it will appear above the video title, and viewers will see it hyperlinked.</p><h4 id="Categorizing-Your-Video-3"><a href="#Categorizing-Your-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Categorizing Your Video"></a>Categorizing Your Video</h4><p>After uploading your video, you should categorize it by going to Advanced settings. By choosing a category, YouTube will group your videos with similar content. Viewers will find your quickly, as they will come in the right audience searches. In turn, this will help your videos to rank higher.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>With 720,000 hours of video being uploaded every day to YouTube, getting your videos to rank high is challenging. But by paying attention to the above YouTube ranking factors, you can improve your video ranking.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-expressive-sketches-for-fortnite-icons-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Expressive Sketches for Fortnite Icons for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/your-first-step-to-a-profitable-youtube-experience-for-2024/"><u>Your First Step to a Profitable Youtube Experience for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-skyrocket-viewer-count-the-most-proven-ways-to-enhance-views/"><u>[Updated] Skyrocket Viewer Count  The Most Proven Ways to Enhance Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-unveiling-our-exclusive-package-of-free-youtube-adornments/"><u>[Updated] Unveiling Our Exclusive Package of Free YouTube Adornments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-boosting-budgets-with-effective-youtube-marketing/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Boosting Budgets with Effective YouTube Marketing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-essential-tips-for-crafting-youtube-image-marketing/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Essential Tips for Crafting YouTube Image Marketing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-comprehensive-guide-to-youtube-content-moderation-rules/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Comprehensive Guide to YouTube Content Moderation Rules</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-become-a-shorts-connoisseur-must-know-facts-for-2024/"><u>[New] Become a Shorts Connoisseur  Must-Know Facts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-narrating-your-journey-channeling-authenticity-online/"><u>[Updated] Narrating Your Journey  Channeling Authenticity Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-tapping-into-tiktoks-magic-secrets-to-surpassing-your-competitors/"><u>[Updated] Tapping Into TikTok's Magic  Secrets to Surpassing Your Competitors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-video-voiceover-software-for-pc-for-2024/"><u>New The Ultimate Guide to Video Voiceover Software for PC for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-unlock-potential-a-list-of-must-try-bots-in-discord/"><u>[New] Unlock Potential  A List of Must-Try Bots in Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/most-admired-free-online-archives-with-a-collection-of-guitar-lyrics-and-artwork/"><u>Most Admired Free Online Archives with a Collection of Guitar Lyrics and Artwork</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-erase-iphone-6-plus-when-its-locked-within-seconds-by-drfone-ios/"><u>3 Ways to Erase iPhone 6 Plus When Its Locked Within Seconds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-tuneup-snapchat-a-guide-to-musical-video-clips/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  TuneUp Snapchat  A Guide to Musical Video Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/new-whos-the-best-tivos-dvr-vs-comcasts-x1-platform/"><u>New Whos the Best TiVos DVR vs Comcasts X1 Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-whatsapp-from-iphone-15-plus-to-other-iphone-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-whatsapp-from-ios-transfer-whatsapp-from-ios/"><u>How To Transfer WhatsApp From iPhone 15 Plus to other iPhone devices? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-secrets-to-preserving-online-broadcasts-professionally/"><u>[New] Secrets to Preserving Online Broadcasts Professionally</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-androids-top-10-moba-gaming-spectacles-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Android's Top 10 MOBA Gaming Spectacles for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

People are more likely to do something if you give them a bit of a nudge, and that includes subscribing to your YouTube channel.</p><p>There are people who think that if people like their videos they’ll subscribe, so they shouldn’t bother people by asking. This is, simply put, wrong. When people are browsing YouTube their minds are on what video they want to watch next, not whether or not they want to subscribe – unless you remind them.</p><ol><li><a href="#cta">What is a ‘Call To Action’?</a></li><li><a href="#betterway">A More Effective Way of Asking for Subscribers</a>  <ol><li><a href="#hook">Step 1: How to Hook the Viewer</a>  </li><li><a href="#point">Step 2: Get to The Point Quickly</a>  </li><li><a href="#moment">Step 3: Create a Moment - Make Subscribing Part of the Experience</a></li></ol></li></ol><h2 id="What-is-a-‘Call-To-Action’"><a href="#What-is-a-‘Call-To-Action’" class="headerlink" title="What is a ‘Call To Action’?"></a>What is a ‘Call To Action’?</h2><p>It has become the norm for YouTubers to ask viewers to subscribe in their sign-offs. A typical CTA (‘call to action’) goes something like this:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Thanks for watching. If you liked this video, make sure to subscribe for more!”</em></p></blockquote><p>That’s great. At the end of a video is a good place to ask people to subscribe, but is it the best and only place you should be reminding them? If you take a peek at your analytics and you might find that most of your viewers aren’t watching to the ends of your videos (people have short attention spans).</p><h2 id="A-More-Effective-Way-of-Asking-For-Subscribers"><a href="#A-More-Effective-Way-of-Asking-For-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="A More Effective Way of Asking For Subscribers"></a>A More Effective Way of Asking For Subscribers</h2><p>Collins Key is one YouTuber who has mastered asking for subscribers early on, and given that he has over 7 million subscribers himself I’d say it’s working out. Check out the technique in this video collab with Brooklyn and Bailey:</p><h4 id="Step-1-How-to-Hook-The-Viewer"><a href="#Step-1-How-to-Hook-The-Viewer" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: How to Hook The Viewer"></a>Step 1: How to Hook The Viewer</h4><p>As you can see, the video starts with a ‘flash forward’ to one of the twins saying the heater is on fire and then a reminder of what’s going to happen later – the heater catching fire – is written in the top left of the screen so it stays on the viewers’ mind. This is one way in which the viewer is immediately hooked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ask-people-to-subscribe-by-hook.jpg"                      alt="how to ask people to subscribe"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Get-to-The-Point-Quickly"><a href="#Step-2-Get-to-The-Point-Quickly" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Get to The Point Quickly"></a>Step 2: Get to The Point Quickly</h4><p>Shortly after, while still in the first 30 seconds of the video, Collins gets right to the point and introduces the Twin Telepathy Challenge promised in the title of the video. The hook with the heater catching fire is effective, but it’s not essential. It happens to suit Collins’ style, and it happens to have happened. Getting to the main point of the video quickly – usually in the first 15 seconds, not the first 30 (it’s in the first 15 seconds that most viewers click away) – is vital. People click on videos for a reason, and if they don’t see a sign of that payoff quickly they’ll leave.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Create-A-Moment-Make-Subscribing-Part-of-the-Experience"><a href="#Step-3-Create-A-Moment-Make-Subscribing-Part-of-the-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Create A Moment - Make Subscribing Part of the Experience"></a>Step 3: Create A Moment - Make Subscribing Part of the Experience</h4><p>It’s only after hooking the viewer in and reiterating the promise of the title that Collins asks viewers to subscribe. The really clever thing about how he asks is that he carves out time in the video for the viewer to comply with his request. He gives 5 seconds and does a countdown.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ask-people-to-subscribe-in-perfect-moment.jpg"                      alt="how to ask people to subscribe"                ></p><p>Collins Key has been one of the fastest-growing channels on YouTube. He does not implement this strategy in every video, but it’s not a stretch to think it’s had something to do with his success. Instead of simply asking you to subscribe at the end of the video, he creates a part of the video early on – before people who don’t watch until the end will have clicked away – where you feel as if you’re ‘supposed to’ subscribe.</p><h3 id="Polish-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Polish-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Polish Your YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Polish Your YouTube Videos with Filmora</h3><p>Even with the above tricks, you may not get the subscribers as you wish unless you can make sure your videos and contents are of high quality. As YouTube is getting more and more popular and more YouTubers are competing for subscribers, you will need to polish your YouTube videos.</p><p>As one of the most widely used video editing software in YouTube video editing, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provides lots of templates and effects with an intuitive interface, which saves much time.

action videos for your vlog with a DSLR camera is impractical. They’re heavy and bulky, getting in the way of whatever you’re doing. Action cameras like the GoPro and Polaroid Cube are much better for these occasions because they’re small enough to be mounted on a bike or a helmet. The Polaroid Cube also has built-in magnets on the top and bottom of the camera, giving you the ability to attach them to most metal surfaces. The camera’s 1.4-inch rubber body is resistant to water, shock, and all types of weather and it is capable of capturing footage even under the most extreme weather conditions. The Cube action camera can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and it has a 124-degree wide-angle lens that performs best when it is used for exterior shots. The camera is compatible with microSDHC memory cards that can store up to 128GB of footage. The Cube’s battery can record up to 107 minutes before it needs another charge. With the Polaroid Cube+, you can preview or control your camera from your phone because it comes with Wi-Fi connectivity. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Cheap vlogging camera for outdoor videos</em> <em>- Multiple mounting options</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Low-quality built-in microphone</em> <em>- No preview screen</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/yi-4k.png"                      alt="Yi 4K"                ></td><td>Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $200: Yi 4K If you are looking for an affordable vlogging camera that costs less than $200, then currently the best option for you is the Yi 4K Action Camera. Its 2.19” LCD Gorilla Glass retina touchscreen is resistant to scratches and mild impacts. Much like a lot of action cameras, this camera is equipped with a wide-angle lens, 160-degree to be exact. The camera, however, is not waterproof, and you need to buy additional accessories so you can protect the camera from accidental damage. You can record 120 minutes of 4K footage at 60 fps without having to recharge the camera’s 4.35V lithium-ion battery. All the footage you record with the Yi 4K action camera can easily be transferred to a computer or broadcasted live on Facebook, YouTube, and other live streaming platforms using the camera’s high-speed 5GHz Wi-Fi feature. The built-in EIS (electronic image stabilization) contains a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer that reduces the camera shakes caused by movements and enables you to produce smooth recordings of your wildest adventures. The Yi 4K action camera has two built-in microphones that can capture audio recordings, but there is no audio jack input for recording audio from an external microphone. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Weighs only 3.4 Oz</em> <em>- Powerful electronic image stabilization</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Limited mounting capabilities</em> <em>- The camera’s fisheye lens can distort footage</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-b500.png"                      alt="Nikon B500"                ></td><td>Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $300: Nikon B500 Unlike the action cams that can capture ultra-wide-angle shots, the Nikon’s Coolpix B500 model is designed to also help you zoom in closer. The camera has a built-in 40X optical zoom NIKKOR lens that can be extended to 80X when used with the Dynamic Fine Zoom feature, which means you can easily record things that are further away. The Nikon Coolpix B500’s ISO can only go up to ISO 3200, despite the camera’s 16 MP BSI-CMOS sensor that supports full HD 1080p recording at 30 or 25 fps. The 3-inch 920K-dot LCD screen is fully adjustable but it doesn’t have touchscreen functionality, and the camera doesn’t have a viewfinder, which can slightly complicate the process of composing shots for your vlogs. The Nikon Coolpix B500 is conveniently powered by 4 AA batteries. This cheap vlogging camera offers more features than similar cameras in its price range. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Great connectivity features</em> <em>- 80x optical zoom</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No manual exposure controls</em> <em>- Limited ISO sensitivity</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-a900.png"                      alt="Nikon A900"                ></td><td>Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $400: Nikon A900 This Coolpix series digital camera model is much more powerful than the Nikon B500 because it is a 20.3 MP camera that can record videos in UHD 4K quality. The non-interchangeable 35X optical zoom NIKKOR f&#x2F;3.4-6.9 lens performs well in capturing footage of both closeup and faraway objects. Like the B500, the A900’s ISO sensitivity goes up to a maximum of 3200. Consequently, this camera won’t be ideal for filming in poorly lit conditions. The Nikon Coolpix A900 features a variety of handy modes, including creative, super lapse, and multiple exposure modes, to mention a few. The SnapBridge app allows you to connect the camera to a smartphone or a tablet via the built-in Wi-Fi NFC so you can transfer and edit the footage immediately after you stop recording. The A900 is a small and light digital camera, which makes it a great companion on your daily vlogging adventures. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- 4K and Full HD video recording options</em> <em>- Manual exposure control</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Limited audio recording features</em> <em>- No viewfinder</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/sony-a5100.png"                      alt="Sony a5100"                ></td><td>Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $500: Sony a5100 Sony’s a5100 is the successor of the NEX-5 series. Four years after its initial release in 2014, it is still considered the best vlogging camera under $500. The 24.3 MP Exmor APS-C CMOS sensor and the BIONZ X image processor reduce image noise and increase the level of detail in your vlogs. This mirrorless camera ships with the standard 16-50 mm lens, but it is compatible with all of Sony’s E-mount lenses. The Sony a5100 can record up to 1080p videos at 60 fps. Its HVAC S codec support enables you to produce videos that have 50Mbps bit rates. The Hybrid AF system featuring both a 179 phase-detect points as well as 25 contrast-detect points guarantees that all videos you record with the Sony a5100 will be sharp and in focus. Wi-Fi with NFC feature enables you to easily transfer or share your recorded footage. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- AF speeds exceed all expectations</em> <em>- The camera body is resistant to moderate impact</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Fake shutter sounds</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong> supports most video formats that you can find.

Therefore, the following sections suggest some such programs that can help you <strong>play YouTube video backward</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Free-YouTube-Video-Reversers-Online"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Free-YouTube-Video-Reversers-Online" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Free YouTube Video Reversers Online"></a>Part 1: Best Free YouTube Video Reversers Online</h2><p>There are a few online web programs that are capable of reversing YouTube videos with efficiency.

You can paste the URL of a YouTube video to upload or import the videos from your computer, Dropbox or Google Drive storage. At the time of this writing, Clideo allows only up to <strong>500MB</strong> videos to be uploaded to reverse or convert. As for the acceptability, the portal supports almost all the commonly used formats.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-youtube-video-clideo.jpg"                      alt="Reverse YouTube videos Online - Clideo"                ></p><p>To <strong>play YouTube video backward</strong> with Clideo:</p><ul><li>Visit Clideo’s online reverse tool page: <a class="link"   href="https://clideo.com/reverse-video" >https://clideo.com/reverse-video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>;</li><li>Hover mouse over the down arrow icon next to the <strong>Choose file</strong> button and paste the URL of the YouTube video that you want to reverse;</li><li>After Clideo fetches the video and opens the next page, choose your preferred speed from the right section</li><li>Leave the <strong>Mute video</strong> box checked, or uncheck it if required and then click <strong>Reverse</strong> button to <strong>reverse YouTube video.</strong> The maximum reverse speed that you can apply is 2X.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Kapwing"><a href="#2-Kapwing" class="headerlink" title="2.

Pixiko"></a>5. Pixiko</h3><p>With almost all formats’ support, Pixiko is yet another web-based media editor that can also <strong>reverse YouTube video</strong> with a few mouse clicks. At the time of this writing, Pixiko only accepts the source files from your PC, which means you can’t paste the YouTube link to it directly. At first, you need to download or save the YouTube video on computer and then either drag those clips from your local hard drive to the portal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-youtube-video-pixiko.jpg"                      alt="Reverse YouTube videos Online - Pixiko"                ></p><p>To <strong>play YouTube video backward</strong> with Pixiko:</p><ul><li>On the page <a class="link"   href="https://pixiko.com/editor/video-reverse" >https://pixiko.com/editor/video-reverse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, click anywhere inside the Blue rectangle;</li><li>Locate, select, and upload the downloaded YouTube source video from your PC;</li><li>Click <strong>Reverse</strong> from the lower-right section of the video player window;</li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions from there to manage and <strong>reverse YouTube video</strong> as needed;</li></ul><h2 id="Bonus-Reversing-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Bonus-Reversing-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: Reversing YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Bonus: Reversing YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>With easily reachable editing options and self-explanatory buttons, Wondershare Filmora has gained a decent amount of popularity in the recent years.

I learned from those mistakes and have helped many new YouTubers start their own channels. Here is a list of eight common mistakes that new YouTubers should avoid, along with tips to do things in a better way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/mistakes-to-avoid-as-a-new-youtuber.jpg"                      alt="Mistakes To Avoid As a New YouTuber"                ></p><h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><h3 id="1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision"><a href="#1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision" class="headerlink" title="1. Failing to have a long-term vision"></a>1. Failing to have a long-term vision</h3><p>One common mistake that a lot of new YouTubers make is failing to have a long-term vision. Without a long-term vision, you’re more likely to poorly brand your YouTube channel, drop your YouTube channel activity in busier times, and, midway through, change the type of content you create and upload. None of these are good for your channel!</p><p>If you can think of the kind of content you’ll love to consistently create and share in the long-run, you’ll not only be able to narrow down your brand and effectively communicate to your audience who you are and what your channel is all about, but you’ll also have a better idea on what to put out next.</p><h3 id="2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL"><a href="#2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL" class="headerlink" title="2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL"></a>2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL</h3><p>Another mistake I made with my first YouTube channel was choosing an ineffective custom URL. Because my last name is Kim, I wanted to make my custom URL “YouTube.com&#x2F;kimagination.” But it wasn’t available. So, I took “kimaginati0n” with a zero where the “o” should be. I thought it was a good idea back then but it was a terrible idea.</p><p>Choose a custom URL with words that can’t be confused with other similar-sounding words. For consistency across all your different social media accounts, try to choose a custom URL that matches the usernames of all your other social media channels. If the username you want isn’t available, then keep on trying to come up with a good name that is available. When you’ve secured the same username across all your different social media channels, you can then very simply promote yourself and all your social media channels by displaying just the social media icons followed by your one username.</p><h3 id="3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched"><a href="#3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched" class="headerlink" title="3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched"></a>3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched</h3><p>Many new YouTubers make the mistake of titling their videos in an ineffective way. Rather than coming up with titles that more people might search, they either come up with titles that summarize what the video is about as a whole or title their videos the way big YouTubers do.</p><p>Big YouTubers can take advantage of non-searched, curiosity evoking titles like “You won’t believe what just happened…” because they already have a huge following. Their channels aren’t depending on getting discovered through search. But yours is. So come up with titles that people are actually searching.</p><p>As an example, let’s suppose you vlogged your time backpacking around Europe last summer. Don’t title your YouTube video “My Summer Backpacking Trip.” Instead, title it “Going Up The Eiffel Tower | Beautiful View of Paris!” This way, all the people who are curious about visiting Paris, the Eiffel Tower, and seeing what the view is like from the top of the Eiffel Tower might find your video.</p><h3 id="4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy"><a href="#4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy" class="headerlink" title="4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy"></a>4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy</h3><p>New YouTubers tend to think about their thumbnail images after they’ve finished editing their videos together. This is way too late in the process for something that is so incredibly important in getting views.</p><p>Even before filming, you should think about how you’re going to title your video to get the most views. After that, you should then try to picture, in your head, a thumbnail image that matches your title and creates curiosity and excitement. When you go into filming, you can then make sure to include some footage of you recreating that image.</p><h3 id="5-Making-weak-intros"><a href="#5-Making-weak-intros" class="headerlink" title="5. Making weak intros"></a>5. Making weak intros</h3><p>After you’ve managed to get someone to click on your video through your effective title and thumbnail image strategy, the next challenge is to keep that person watching your video without closing it too early. A typical viewer on YouTube decides within the first ten to fifteen seconds of landing on a video whether or not he or she will stay or leave. This short window of time is so important to set the tone of the rest of your video and build excitement and curiosity in your viewer with an effective, high-energy intro.</p><p>New YouTubers often make the mistake of having weak intros. Starting at the beginning of a story makes sense, right? The beginning, however, is not always the most exciting. Consequently, new YouTubers lose their audience’s attention too early on.</p><p>To read more on how some of the most successful YouTubers effectively do their intros, check out my blogpost on “<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How To Edit YouTube Videos Like a YouTuber <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.”</p><h3 id="6-Forgetting-to-engage-with-subscribers"><a href="#6-Forgetting-to-engage-with-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="6. Forgetting to engage with subscribers"></a>6. Forgetting to engage with subscribers</h3><p>An important thing to do as a new YouTuber is engaging with your subscribers. Some new YouTubers, though, are so focused and busy with the production side of things that they forget to do the community side of things, including responding to comments. By not responding to comments as a new YouTuber, you hurt your potential to get more comments consistently from your subscribers. If your video’s comments section is very active, YouTube ranks your video higher in the videos it recommends to viewers.</p><p>Connecting with your audience shouldn’t just be limited to YouTube either. Use your other social media channels to connect with your audience as well.</p><h3 id="7-Not-promoting-with-social-media"><a href="#7-Not-promoting-with-social-media" class="headerlink" title="7. Not promoting with social media"></a>7. Not promoting with social media</h3><p>YouTube isn’t the only social media platform that people are spending their time on. People are spending their time on all kinds of different social media platforms, like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. The more content in all of these platforms that you create to promote your video, the more potential your video has to be seen by their users.</p><p>New YouTubers sometimes forget to promote their videos and channel using other social media platforms. Consequently, they miss out on the opportunity to get views from multiple sources of social media.</p><h3 id="8-Spamming-comments"><a href="#8-Spamming-comments" class="headerlink" title="8. Spamming comments"></a>8. Spamming comments</h3><p>Commenting on other YouTube videos is another way to get your channel discovered from people reading over comments. If your profile picture and comment appears interesting enough, out of curiosity, people just might click your username to have a look at your channel.</p><p>But rather than leaving interesting comments that are related to the video, rather than adding to the conversation, some new YouTubers desperate to get more subscribers make the mistake of spamming videos with “check out my YouTube channel!” comments.</p><p>Spam comments annoy YouTubers. It would be much more beneficial to your channel to build good relationships with other YouTubers to possibly collaborate on a video together in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-synergistic-videos-to-skyrocket-your-follower-count/"><u>[Updated] Synergistic Videos to Skyrocket Your Follower Count</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-speedy-fortnite-cover-art-creation/"><u>[Updated] Speedy Fortnite Cover Art Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-advanced-techniques-in-post-uploaded-youtube-content-enhancement/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Advanced Techniques in Post-Uploaded YouTube Content Enhancement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-monetizing-video-content-8-essentials-for-novices/"><u>[New] Monetizing Video Content - 8 Essentials for Novices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/unlocking-the-potential-of-youtubes-cc-for-content-creators-for-2024/"><u>Unlocking the Potential of YouTube’s CC for Content Creators for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-8-best-mirrorless-cameras-vloggers-should-know/"><u>[New] In 2024, 8 Best Mirrorless Cameras Vloggers Should Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-boosting-channel-success-scaling-for-a-million-viewers-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Boosting Channel Success  Scaling for a Million Viewers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-revolutionize-your-reacting-skills-with-these-3-pro-level-youtube-tips/"><u>[Updated] Revolutionize Your Reacting Skills with These 3 Pro-Level YouTube Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-curtail-unrequested-youtube-content-streams/"><u>[New] In 2024, Curtail Unrequested YouTube Content Streams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-use-special-features-virtual-location-on-infinix-note-30-vip-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How To Use Special Features - Virtual Location On Infinix Note 30 VIP? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-speed-up-vimeo-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  How to Speed Up Vimeo Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-optimizing-obs-studio-5-editing-game-changers/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Optimizing OBS Studio  5 Editing Game Changers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-minimize-time-maximize-results-with-this-srt-to-txt-hack/"><u>[Updated] Minimize Time, Maximize Results with This SRT to TXT Hack</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-incorporating-markers-a-step-by-step-videography-guide/"><u>[New] Incorporating Markers  A Step-By-Step Videography Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/why-is-ipogo-not-working-on-tecno-phantom-v-flip-fixed-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Why is iPogo not working On Tecno Phantom V Flip?

From CPC to CPM, estimated gross earnings per view, and more. Keep reading to find out more about how these factors affect your YouTube earnings;</p><p><strong>CPM (Cost Per Mile):</strong> CPM is the amount an advertiser pays for every one thousand views of their ads. This means if an advertiser is paying you $10CPM, you’ll earn $10 on every 1000 views of their ads.</p><p><strong>CPC (Cost Per Click):</strong> Most people think CPC is the same as CPM, but no they are not. Cost Per Click is the amount an advertiser pays for every viewer that clicks on their ads. If an advertiser is willing to pay $10, then you’ll earn $10 on every ad click.</p><p><strong>Estimated Gross Earning Per Subscriber:</strong> You’ll notice whenever you watch a YouTube video, the creator always emphasizes you click the Subscribe button to get a notification on every new video he&#x2F;she uploads. Well, they do this because the more subscribers they get, the more likely their videos appear in search results.</p><p>Also, if you have a huge Subscriber base, your videos tend to get more views, thereby increasing ad views, ad clicks, and your earnings.</p><p>All the factors explained above will determine how your YouTube earnings are calculated. However, keep in mind that you’ll receive only 55% of the total dollar advertisers pays while YouTube keeps the remaining 45%. If you get an average of $5 from an advertiser on every 1000 ad view, you’ll earn $5 x 55% which is approximately $2.75.</p><p>You can also calculate your YouTube channel total earnings by using the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tunepocket.com/youtube-money-calculator/" >YouTube calculator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-check-youtube-income-7.jpg"                      alt="how to check youtube income on mobile phone 6"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-do-you-increase-your-YouTube-earnings"><a href="#Part-3-How-do-you-increase-your-YouTube-earnings" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How do you increase your YouTube earnings?"></a>Part 3: How do you increase your YouTube earnings?</h2><h3 id="1-Post-quality-videos"><a href="#1-Post-quality-videos" class="headerlink" title="1.

This means if an advertiser is paying you $10CPM, you’ll earn $10 on every 1000 views of their ads.</p><p><strong>CPC (Cost Per Click):</strong> Most people think CPC is the same as CPM, but no they are not. Cost Per Click is the amount an advertiser pays for every viewer that clicks on their ads. If an advertiser is willing to pay $10, then you’ll earn $10 on every ad click.</p><p><strong>Estimated Gross Earning Per Subscriber:</strong> You’ll notice whenever you watch a YouTube video, the creator always emphasizes you click the Subscribe button to get a notification on every new video he&#x2F;she uploads.
